# Emotion-and-Spam-Inspection-from-EWOM-Electronic-Word-of-Mouth-in-E-Commerce-Platform
To enhance and maintain the world wide communication between consumer and ecommerce websites are fundamentally depends on consumer reviews, which are EWOM (Electronic word of Mouth, means Customer reviews in online) is one of the most significant among all aspects which are impacting the behaviour of consumer. This work requires to work on the data related to an online retail store, In this project we are taking datasets from Amazon.com into consideration.The unwanted data in the dataset will be removed under the analysis of data pre-processing, the remaining data in the dataset will be initiated to analyze the emotion inspection from the consumer critiques using classification algorithms, which are Naive bayes and Support Vector machine (SVM) and both will be cross evaluated to obtain the results for best classifier in this process. In addition to this, we are trying to figure it out the spammer group detection based on the customer feedback on the product. We are implementing spammer group detection method called frequent itemset mining (FIM) by classifying our data in to two types, which are labeled data and unlabeled data. By using above classified data to compute accuracy among data mining algorithms, which are Naive Bayes and Expectation Maximization (EM). we are initiating Naives bayes algorithm to work on labeled data, then it will improves the other classifier using Exception Maximization EM algorithm and perform required iterations on the dataset.
