This is my own opinion of the device.<br /><br />Overall OnHub is a pretty no nonsense type router that just works. Its super simple to setup with your phone, is fast and auto updates. I have not looked back ever since I set it up. The beauty in this router is that it gets better over time. You know what I mean if you have a ChromeBook. It auto updates and you never have to deal with firmware and security updates or adjusting settings on the device to get the optimal performance for your WiFi network. It just figures it out on its own.<br /><br />Why I love it:<br />1) Auto Updates. Probably the one of the main selling points. I have witnessed this first hand. It uses the power of the cloud to update. No security updates to apply, no firmware patches to apply, no need to plug in your laptop to set it up or flash, etc. It does it automatically through the internet.<br /><br />2) It's fast. I probably have 6-7 devices connected through WiFi and they all perform pretty well. I didn’t notice any performance differences when streaming Netflix or YouTube using the Ethernet connection or Wireless network.<br /><br />3) The Android app makes it dead simple to share your WiFi password, perform speed tests on your internet connection, see how much bandwidth devices on your network are using, and updated your typical settings you see in a WiFi router. The added bonus is you can even do it from anywhere you have a internet connection. No need to be on your home network. The default settings worked straight out of the box beautifully. (There is an iOS app, which has similar features)<br /><br />4) There are 2.4GHz and 5GHz antennas which should cover all your devices. The interesting bit for me, was that you only need one SSID for both frequencies. There is no concept of network-name and network-name-5g if you have a used a router in the past that broadcasted both frequencies. It will automatically figure out which is the better frequency for you and use that.<br /><br />5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings. You control everything through your phone, including adding additional managers to administer the device. Although, I haven’t actually had the need to use this, it might come in handy to help a friend or family member if they had some questions.<br /><br />6) It looks nice enough that I don’t need to hide it in my TV stand and can leave it out in the open.<br /><br />Why you may not like it:<br />1) The OnHub only has 1 Ethernet port, where as my old router had 4. While I thought I would miss this early on, I actually found that connecting all my devices via WiFi just seemed so much simpler and cleaner. If you need more ports for wired internet access, you will need a switch.<br /><br />2) There is no web interface to administrate the device, but I didn’t really miss it. Well, okay I will admit I did at first, since I was so use to it from my old access point. After the initial setup though, you don’t really need to touch any settings. As I mentioned before, you control everything through your phone, if you need to change anything or check the status.<br /><br />Future Wish List:<br />There is a pretty nice looking speaker on top that I heard during setup. It would be cool if this could be used in some other ways, other than just for setup. Maybe a future update?use that.  5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings.

The range and speed was acceptable, although, for the price I would have liked better. This would probably have been a 3 or 4 star review except, as of mid July, 2015, it has stopped working properly. One day, out of the blue, it no longer provided an internet connection. The wireless network still exists but all devices attached show no internet connection. The same happens for any devices connected via Ethernet through the router. I have tried all the following in troubleshooting:<br />1: connected straight to the modem and had an internet connection.<br />2: Reset to factory settings and connected to default network but no internet.<br />3: Connected replacement router via same ethernet cable to the modem and it provided internet without issue.<br />4: checked router, power adapter, and Ethernet cable for any signs of damage (we have a cat) but none exist.<br /><br />So, As a result, I am rather upset that this product did not even last 2 years. I paid $135 for this thing new. It I had wanted a disposable product i would have spent 30 bucks on a cheap wireless N router and called it a day.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a fix or something for this issue, I will try it and gladly take this up to 3 or so stars but for the time being, I really believe it deserves one star.",2015-08-31

Enter the Seagate 2TB drive. Now I can have that feeling again of, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34;<br /><br />This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive, priced similar to other 2TB drives, but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design. When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $400, you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives (currently $100) and spend about $450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage. Basically, an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $50, which isn't a bad deal. Of course, you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs.<br /><br />The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive. While it wasn't that difficult for me to figure out, it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work. Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product, it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive's features included. I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content. It was not the most user friendly in that regard. I finished transferring data and wasn't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive (I was). A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360, then upgrade to the Xbox One. I plan to do this in a few weeks, so I mayupdate the review if I hit any other snags in that process.",2015-08-31

Without the Opolar fan, CPU temps were cresting 170°F.  With the Opolar even running at lowest manual speed, temps rarely go above 120°. With the speed tuned up a few clicks, it's rarely above 110°.  I'm really impressed with the effectiveness.<br />The &#34;auto&#34; fan speed function seems like a great idea, but unfortunately it requires a working laptop fan for it to operate.  This seems odd since I imagine that most people buy this (like I did) to replace the cooling function of a dead fan, not as a fan booster.  The auto fan speed control senses the temperature of the air being directed out of the laptop -- perhaps a future version could incorporate a temperature sensor cable that could be placed inside the laptop vent to directly sense the internal temps and control the auto fan speed that way.<br />Pros:  Simple connect and attach. Works really well at keeping laptop CPU temperatures under control. Reasonably quiet even at high speed.<br />Cons: The arms that clamp the device to the side of the laptop could be longer.  They're short enough that the weight of the Opolar itself can sometimes work them loose.  And the previously mentioned auto-speed function not working without a working internal fan.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a well crafted product and I'd recommend it.",2015-08-31

But it was exactly that price point that had me give it a go.  After reading various reviews and weighing my needs I decided to go with the HM-TM04.<br />The form factor is great, roughly the size of a Macbook Pro power brick.<br />What it does well:<br />Battery Backup -- works exactly as you would expect and maybe with a bit of a bonus.  As a real estate agent I am always on my phone and other devices so I have always carried an Anker 10,000mAh external battery bank to recharge my phone on the go.  The thing with the Anker battery back is that I have to physically push a button to get the charge to begin.  Not a big deal but there have been times where I would simply forget to push the button on the battery bank.  With the HooToo there are no buttons to push to charge a device,  just plug it in and it automatically starts charging.  No, it doesn't have the same capacity as the Anker but it's more than enough to recharge my phone and still have enough left over to do it's other functions for quite some time.<br /><br />Wireless router/Bridge -- This is the feature that sold me.  There will be times where I will go to a hotel or home where there simply isn't any wifi available and only having hardwired solutions.  That used to be fine when laptops had ethernet ports and no one had smartphones or tablets but now wireless is becoming more and more the standard.  Simply plug the ethernet cable into the HooToo, turn the HooToo on and bam, youre own wifi with it's own security so you can either keep the wifi to yourself or allow others to use it.  Fantastic for travel.  Ever go to a hotel or on a plane where they limit how many users/devices.  Pay once and bam, hookup as many as you want.  Also allows you to act as a wireless bridge.  Connect to a wireless network and output your own network, particularly nice so you don't have to sign in on every device you and your family has.  Sign in with the HooToo and everyone can automatically connect to the HooToo that they had previously signed into.<br /><br />AC Charger -- I admittedly don't use this too much but it can be nice for travel so you're not carrying a bunch of wall warts around.  The built in AC plug is nice as well, no more carrying around a wall wart adapter to charge the battery back up.  Just flip out the prongs and you're good to go, charge the battery backup all the while charging other devices.<br /><br />NAS -- Mass storage for all of your devices while on the go. Super simple, just plug it in and automatically available to anyone connected to the HooToo network.  Have tested with a thumbdrive to a external hard drive, works great for both.  Awesome for moving pictures/videos from your phone to the external storage without having to be connected to cell service or physically connected to a computer.  Great for vacations where your phone storage might be full and you want to take more pictures but not at the expense of deleting other pictures from the device.<br /><br />Software -- This is the HooToos major downfall.  The hardware is great but the software is fairly clunky.  It gets the job done and is functional but could use some UI/UX upgrades.  But they have updated it since I bought so it's at least being worked on and has improved over the months.<br /><br />For the price you really can't beat it.  It's not too much more than a standard battery bank but you get SO much more out of the HooToo.",2015-08-31

For the price you can't expect much, the pre-order price made a it a no brainer, you would be hard pressed to find another laptop sub $400 with a full 1080p display. Battery life seems to be about 3 hours from my experience, that's a combo of installing application, web browsing and writing code.  If you don't have any intention of gaming, you will find this to be a wonderful laptop. The integrated Intel, while they are progressing, can't hold a candle to a real dedicated GPU. Battery life isn't as great as I was hoping, but not bad. It can still be mobile, but not the 5-6 hours I've had in a nice quad core i7 mac book pro from way back in 2011. The hard drive does seem fast enough for normal use. Keyboard is okay, not great but seems to work for what I need.  Pros 1080p &#60;-- this is what pushes it to the top of the budget laptops in my book. (developer) Pretty thin and lite. Enough processing power. Enough memory.  Cons, not really cons just really considerations. It's a mobile i3, not for heavy processing. 4gb of memory, I routinely see 60-70% usage 5,400rpm drive, not a deal breaker but in the world of SSD's, its pretty slow. Trackpad feels pretty cheap.  There is some extra junk installed, but it wasn't hard to remove. I have since ordered another 4gb stick of memory and a SSD but have not installed it yet. From what I've found out the upgrade process is a lot more work than it should be. Also I have not been able to find any real specs or manual online or in the box for this specific model to tell you things like, the max memory supported etc.  This is all subjective to my experience, your mileage will vary.  After having read my review, it's pretty indecisive. I want to say that for normal day to day use, it will serve you well. Just no gaming or heavy processing.",2015-08-31

I received  this card yesterday and have it installed on a ASUS X99 A/USB3.1 board. It is running perfectly. ASUS's tuning software is surprisingly good. After overall fan adjustments it runs at 39C which is quite good and is lower than any other card I have and  have used. For an OCed card this is impressive. The build quality and materials used are exceptional, fully automated assembly lines too ya know, and that is important to me. I bought a competitor's R9 280A and it has a white noise coming through the HDMI port that I use for audio only. Totally unacceptable. I sent it back 8 days ago to the retailer, ya know, Amazon's closest completer, by numbers only, and still haven't been able to resolve the return as they are stalling for really stupid manipulative reasons. Liars and thieves do those things. I will never buy anything from that retailer ever again and will pass the word everywhere. Amazon is the very best of the e-tailers, by a long shot, and Amazon Prime is a huge win. I have never had a unresolved issue with Amazon, and quickly too, and have been won over with their customer service and Amazon will get it all, if possible, from me. The card is excellent. You guys and gals know what this card can do and I'm not gonna write performance specs.

Chiclet style keys, multi-colored back-lit functionality, macro keys, usb ports and the added plus of having mic/audio ports as well as a fan. (Even though I rarely use the fan.)<br /><br />The only thing that I do not like about this keyboard are how some of the keys are designed. The space bar, enter, ctrl keys, tab, backspace, forward slash key, enter on numpad, + key on numpad, capslock and the shift keys. They are designed with a metal retention bar that spans across the bottom of the key to keep it level when you push the key down. Over repeated use on one side of the keys, like the space bar for instance, it will wear out the plastic clamp section that holds the bar in-place. Once that wears out, the key will be nearly un-operational (by pressing it on one side, rather than the center.) unless you use tape or something to hold it. I used electrical tape to repair the spacebar and enter key, which I should have gone with a clear tape so it isn't as noticeable, but it gets the job done and it doesn't bother me much.<br /><br />Other than the design flaw on some of the keys it works nicely, I would recommend getting a warranty from squaretrade or something to cover the life span of the keyboard. I have owned this keyboard for a little over a year and besides the enter and space keys wearing down a bit (probably from applying too much force as I type fairly hard sometimes.) it still works great.<br /><br />I attached some images to show you how some of the keys are designed. The key I used to show you is the right shift key. The metal bar goes across the back of the key then slides into the arms (or whatever you want to call it) onto the keyboard to allow, I suppose, a &#34;smoother&#34; button push response.",2015-08-31

I decided to stream line all the runs and fix some short comings from the previous build. The new build would require me to have some perfectly straight runs out of the rads and at this point is when it come to my attention that the ports weren't straight. This made impossible to run little straight runs since the fittings would be in a obvious angle destroying the aesthetics of the build. I contacted XSPC about the issue in which I received the reply that it is normal for the ports to not be straight and that I was s@#$ out of luck &#34;basically&#34;. So after some research I come to the decision of trying to forcefully bend the ports straight. A method not recommended since it can destroy the rad if not done right. Did some re-planning and decided I would only do that to one port which thankfully I was lucky to be able to do it without breaking the darn thing. Overall with this garbage of a experience I went from a XSPC fan boy to a full on hater. And next time around when I decide to redo my loop I will replace everything and will look towards other brands. And on top of that I will make sure to test very carefully radiator ports and other aspects and if any imperfections are found I will immediately return it to take advantage of return policies from places like Amazon instead of getting a stick up the A@@ from companies that do not respect the customer's warranties. It was a five star review but now it goes down to two... because it still performs okay, and looks good but if support is non existent and warranties are trash then there is nothing more to the products offered by this company.<br /><br />My last build I was using some Alphacool Radiators. They performed well but lacked on asthetics big time. So new build is going to be black and white and this radiators seemed to be the perfect fit. Whey I opened the box I was amazed. The radiator just feels like a top end product. The build quality, the painting, the connectors... I dont care if they wont perform as well. This things are amazing. Highly recomend it. Got this 360 and one 240. Once the build is done I will update the review to include the picture.",2015-08-31

So when I got my iPad 2, I knew I needed a protective case because, without a doubt, I knew I would break it within the first week. I searched around and, having decided that I wanted something stylish but minimalist and sleek, I wanted to try this case. It arrived in a plastic sleeve to keep it safe in transit and there's foam inside so that it's perfect when it arrives. The iPad 2 fits in it beautifully. This case is extremely slim but quite effective and it's also super sturdy! It fits beautifully and the pale blue dandelion pattern is really beautiful. My favourite colour also happens to be blue so this goes with most of the other cases on my essential electronics. I find this case to be a bit easier to use than the ones I have used in the past, better use of buttons and it shows the logo out the back. I've had a few people tell me how much they like it. True to form, I have already dropped my iPad 2 and sat on it and this case has taken the beating for it! I never have to go in fear of breaking my tablet now.

I managed to slosh what amounted to a few table-spoons of coffee onto the keyboard. I promptly turned it upside down while pressing the power button to turn it off. I left it in a tented position for 24 hours after removing the batter, etc. all the usual things to make sure it was well ventilated. Result, about three months later: intermittent hard drive failures. Repair bill: $650. They want to replace pretty much everything inside, not just the keyboard: system board, chassis and fan assembly. So, what I saved by not buying directly from Lenovo and getting a break fix warranty (relying on the shock-proof solid state drive and &#34;spill proof&#34; keyboard) was money ill spent. It's a laptop. Things happen to laptops. You are better off buying it from Lenovo directly and getting a break/fix warranty, because if something stupid happens you will have saved zero dollars.

Samsung does not make this drive. They do not even make this style. What you have here is a generic USB flash drive stamped with the Samsung name and packaged up in an equally counterfeit package.<br /><br />On top of that, counterfeit drives are invariably fake-capacity drives - low capacity drives hacked to make them appear to have a much higher capacity.<br /><br />FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br/>Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.",2015-08-31

Thankfully the controller is a little better than the device it was initially designed for.<br /><br />In addition to supporting the Forge console the Serval also works with other Android devices (like phones and tablets) as well as Macs and PCs. The controller connects wirelessly via bluetooth (it requires two included AA batteries) or directly without batteries via the included USB cable. It has a standard micro USB interface. It does NOT work with iOS devices like iPhones and iPads.<br /><br />Some gamers are going to love this controller while others will hate it. Why? Because of the button travel - the depth that the buttons can be pushed down. The four action buttons have a very short travel time (along with mechanical switches) which allow for very rapid fire button mashing, but that might not be ideal for people more accustomed to the deeper travel and squishier feel on Xbox and Playstation devices.<br /><br />And while the travel time on the main buttons is short, the directional pad travel is deeper than other controllers, making retro games like Sonic the Hedgehog more difficult to play. The control sticks feel stiffer than other controllers I've used - this does allow for more fine controls.<br /><br />Bottom line? It's not for everyone. But if you have stick-based games that require a lot of button mashing you might like what Razer has done here with the controller.",2015-08-31

I too, had been plagued by blisters, especially on opening day of pheasant season, so I started using bag balm and it really helped!<br /><br />Now in my late 60s, and plagued by dry, cracking skin, I use bag balm often and find it is a real remedy - great product!<br />Chris Gregory, Tekoa WA",2015-08-31

Typing is smooth and--relative to other mechanical keyboards--relatively quiet. The textured spacebar and textured WASD keys (provided but not installed) are comfortable and good for keeping your fingers oriented. The red LED lighting effects are impressive but not really necessary. The two USB cables provided (only 1 needed for USB 3.0) are thick and should be durable. I used the on-keyboard USB port for my mouse, with no problems. All keys are programmable, but no special keys are provided unless you count the FN key to the right of the spacebar that replaces the right Windows key. The FN key allows you to use the media controls that are combined with the function keys along the top of the keyboard--something you often see on laptops. Compared to Corsair's fancier models like the K95 I purchased a while back, Corsair has shaved money and space off of this keyboard by omitting the bank of dedicated programmable keys, replacing the brushed aluminum case with plastic, omitting the dedicated media keys (and other special keys, like those for macro recording or profile-switching), and dropping the wrist rest. The included 8 textured keycaps (WASD, QWERDF) and keycap puller, however, are a nice perk. The keyboard uses the Corsair Utility Engine software, which has lots of options and can be rather intimidating to new users (including me). The software and documentation do not ship with the keyboard but are easily downloaded from Corsair's web site. There is essentially no documentation on the hardware, however.<br /><br />One more note on the comparison to the K95: Although the Strafe technically has better anti-ghosting and rollover, I didn't notice any improvement in steering my roller or in swapping weapons in Defiance--the areas where I had previously had the most problems. (Defiance was the game I played most frequently during testing.) The reason may be that my problem is network lag rather than the keyboard; if you're playing online and the network lag isn't significantly shorter than the keyboard lag, a faster keyboard isn't going to help you.<br /><br />Bottom line: Solid keyboard, but MMO gamers and some others may find the lack of extra programmable keys to be problematic. Also, if you really need a spectacular lightshow from your keyboard, you should hold out for an RGB model. And while everybody is skimping on technical documentation these days, a short hardware manual does not seem too much to ask for.viously had the most problems.

While Cisco enterprise feature set can do more than MikroTik, if you're using Cisco IP base license and even the security license, you should find just about anything you need in a MikroTik CCR.  It will take some time to get used to but you'll be rewarded.  The only drawback in this platform is WAN connectivity.  There is no option to put modems, T1 cards, etc. in the MikroTik.  It is Ethernet only but they don't purposely throttle the performance like Cisco has done for many years.  If you can get T1 delivered in Ethernet via Adtran or similar, use MetroEthernet and Internet connections, you're in a great position to have achieve really great performance at a lower price than Cisco.  I've been using Cisco since the 90's and use them in small, medium and large deployments but sometimes you just need something with higher performance at a great price.  MikroTik has been the best solution.  We have large deployments in networks with over 30 MikroTik routers from the smallest to the CCR and we've been extremely satisfied.",2015-08-31

I did purchases at a discounted price, I still spent quite a bit of money because I purchased two of these. I purchased the pink one for my daughter and the blue one for my son as a Christmas gift, trying to get an early start.  When I received these and opened them up I was very happy with the way they look visually. The colors are much more vibrant in person than they are in the picture, it really doesn't do it justice. The pink is very bright and the blue is very eye-catching.  I love the size of these because my kids can watch movies online and hold these in their lap easily without dropping them. They are not heavy, very lightweight. I have powered these off and on and played around with them with no problem. They connected to the Internet easily and it was also easy to access all the tools within this tablet. I love that you could put them in a bag and carry them with ease, for me it's good entertainment for my kids when I'm busy trying to do other things.  The screen is nice and easy to clean, you can see the graphics very easily and the settings are easy to change.  So far so good and I'm happy with my purchases my only concern is the durability  of these tablets especially being used by kids only time will tell.<br /><br />I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback",2015-08-31

One of the pictures showed the ability to use this briefcase as a backpack. Unfortunately, you cannot without lots of effort, time and annoyance. The strap is long enough to suffice the backpack configuration, but it does not set when placing it on. For example, when placing one arm through the opening to place on your shoulder, the other side of the strap pulls which does not allow you to place your other arm. I used my kitchen counter for help and it did not go well. LOL.<br /><br />Definitely condition the leather for a soft, conformed feel and to break it in. I placed many books inside and conditioned it, because the bag is stiff. [Duh, it's leather.] Be sure to loosen the two overlap straps which secure the bag closed, because the bottom is dependent on them-you'll lose adequate space when they are tight. The overlap straps are looped through rings at the bottom. I configured the overlap straps as shown in the main picture, because it is work unbuckling all three. The middle strap does just fine, but use caution if you carry the bag by its handle.<br /><br />Spending $199 for this bag was not worth the one use I reasoned to buy. I know it is a briefcase. Situations have occurred many times where I wish I could use it like a backpack for ease of traveling through the airport. There are no instructions on the many configurations this bag is capable of doing. I'm smart enough to figure it out on my own, but if there is a way to set the strap steady when using as a backpack . . . please send me it.",2015-08-31

The switches feel very light and fluid with a slight tactile feedback, but I can also rest my hands on the keys themselves without depressing them. The key tops are shaped differently from probably any other keyboard, and the edges take some getting used to. As other users have said, the key tops make the key spacing feel slightly different, but the spacing is actually about the same (if not exactly the same) as is standard for Logitech. The key laser etching looks fantastic, and the lighting for each key is confined only to that key with a very uniform brightness.<br /><br />The keyboard feels nice and weighty - not necessarily heavy, but it feels like it is durable. The quality of plastic used feels very high quality, not like the standard plastic you find in most keyboards. As stated, it comes with two palm rests. The one typically pictured is good for gaming, but it forces your hands into a slightly asymmetric position, unsuitable for typing. The second, smaller palm rest is the one I keep on the keyboard. It is wide enough for a guy with fairly large hands. It is also what you would want to use for typing, as it keeps your hands positioned more symmetrically.<br /><br />Overall, I am highly pleased with my purchase and would recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for a high end mechanical keyboard.

So far it's excellent! It is essentially the same shape as the Logitech MX 510 and Performance MX mice that I have used for years in a slightly smaller form factor. Even so, it fits my paw of a hand very comfortably. But the smaller size makes it easily stowed in a laptop bag. It uses one AA battery and a USB nano receiver which stores neatly and securely in the battery compartment when traveling. There is power button on the bottom for battery conservation when not in use. The scroll wheel is clicky, which I prefer, and there are side buttons for backward and forward paging in browsers.The sensitivity seems perfect to me but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Installation was trivial. Insert the battery, power on the mouse, insert the receiver,  and the drivers install automatically (Windows 10). It did not install any bloatware or additional crapware that must be manually disabled or uninstalled, as Logitech loves to do. Very clean and minimalistic.<br /><br />Time will tell if it stands up to moderate use or there are other warts. I worry that the battery cover compartment may be flimsy for repeated open/close to remove/store the receiver. However, so far this is flawless and the price is unbeatable. Exactly what I wanted.

Previous brands used: Buffalo - still the overall best for experimenters and tinkers when running DD-WRT (still have and use a closet full).<br /><br />OK, I haven't bought a new router in a while (several years).  Usually I buy Buffalo, but decided to try something different this time for the heck of it.  I did some reading and came across the TP-Link brand.  To be honest, this was the first I'd ever heard of it.  I haven't kept up with all the new ratings like AC1250, AC1900 and up.  I use routers to connect stuff to the internet (65Mb dl speed), not move vast amounts of files from one user to another in house, so pretty much any router can do what I need.<br /><br />The AC2600 and 3200 routers looked cool, but the prices didn't.  This TP 1900 was actually a little more than I wanted to spend, but some reading on this beam forming stuff now out there piqued my interest.  So, give it a shot.<br /><br />Set up was easy.  There's a fairly decent instruction sheet for those that want it (a violation of my Ham Radio Code of Operation to refer to instruction sheets).  It would be pretty tough to physically set this router up wrong.  It stands on something of your choice and apparently does not have a way to wall hang (unless you make one).<br /><br />Config using the built in app was easy.  As with nearly all routers there are pages and pages of really cool looking things to modify and change.  Unless you are really a power user, leave those alone.  Messing with those for most of us is like teaching a pig to sing - it doesn't accomplish much and annoys the pig.  One thing I did go into in the extended setting to do was set up port forwarding for control software of my home security system.  Piece of cake, but probably not something most users would ever do.<br /><br />CHANGE THE DEFAULT USER, PASSWORD AND SSID.  If you do nothing else, do this.<br /><br />I've had this going for a week or so now.  It perks right along, delivering the full speed of my cable internet (65m) over the entire house.  My previous router (an older Buff) had some weak spots.  This one is full scale on my entire property, inside and out (a lot about 100'x50'.<br /><br />Bottom line:  PRO's - works well, easy to set up and does exactly what I want a router to do.

Let me elaborate on what I think the problem is.<br /><br />The charger itself have no buttons. To view its current battery level, you have to plug in a cable to either of the slots, and its battery level indicator will light up for a few seconds, and then switch off. If I plug in another device on the other end, e.g., an iPad, the battery indicator will be kept on, and the iPad will get charged until this battery pack runs out of juice. However, when I plug in my headphones (I've tried a [[ASIN:B00TSTVJ86 SoundBot SB553 Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Earbud Stereo Earphone Headset w/ Ultra Light Weight, In-Line Control, Built-in Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Battery, Multi-Point Connectivity Technology, 100hrs Stand by Time, 5hrs Talk Time, 33feet Wireless Range, Built-in Mic, Tangle-Resistant Flat Cable, & Crystal Clear Sound Technology for Music Streaming and HandsFree Talking for Android, Apple, iPhone 6, 6 Plus, iPad, Smartphone, Tablets, PC, Video, Laptops and More]] and a [[ASIN:B00STP86HC Soundpeats Qy7 Mini Lightweight Wireless Stereo Sports/running & Gym/exercise Bluetooth Earbuds Headphones Headsets W/microphone for Iphone 5s 5c 4s 4, Ipad 2 3 4 New Ipad, Ipod, Android, Samsung Galaxy, Smart Phones Bluetooth Devices (black/blue)]], the battery indicator will go off after a few seconds, as if nothing has been plugged in. I believe this is due to the low current draw from these devices. The charger doesn't think anything has been plugged in so it switches off. I have other chargers and they all charge these headphones, so this is a unique problem with this charger. If they had implemented a button like most other chargers to allow users to check battery level, then they didn't have to put in this kind of power off logic. Very disappointing.<br /><br />Check the attached photos to see how the headphones get charged for only a few seconds. Everything lights up and then after a few seconds? It's dark.",2015-08-31

I have taken many of these apart and have done fairly in depth troubleshooting as well as upgrading.<br /><br />Overall the 5540 is a decent laptop. It works fairly well. Over all if the laptop is taken well care of it will give years of good service.  While I'm not a huge Dell fan, I have learned to work around the issues that their laptops present and this one tends to have only a few.<br /><br />The main issue we had with this laptop is not really a big issue for the average user who doesn't take their computer apart, but for those of us who like to upgrade our laptops, the E5540 is a bit of a pain.<br /><br />If you decide to upgrade your memory, HDD or WiFi, the laptop is particularly difficult to take the back off. Some people could have seriously issues getting it off and the clips sometimes refuse to let go without prying tools. I have broken tabs off of more than one of these. I created a video for our end users that you might find useful in showing the process of removing the cover: https://youtu.be/hqz2ApVrAQ4<br />Keep in mind this is not the most difficult cover I've ever removed. Some of the old older laptops win that category.<br /><br />On the subject of memory installs, we had many issues with the E5540 and memory. It says that it will take dual voltage memory but we had many issues where it would not take this kind of memory. Apparently the laptop would read the high power mode (1.5v) and fail to even turn on. Matching two dual-voltage mode SODIMMs would usually fix the problem, but definitely don't mix a PC3L and a dual mode chip.<br /><br />Regarding software issues: When it comes to drivers, Dell's drivers are usually fine. The only exception is the Intel PROset drivers. We experienced issues with the drivers that came on the laptop. Whenever the laptop would go to sleep, the Wireless drivers would fail and the device would appear to be uninstalled. Disabling/Re-enabling the device in the Device Manager or rebooting the laptop would fix the issue. The permanent fix was to update the Intel PROset drivers to the latest version (17.14+). This stopped the issue entirely.<br /><br />Other than that, the laptop is pretty standard in it's setup. There may be issues that I don't know about, but the only real issue we had with these laptops is the track pad on some laptops would die requiring a replacement.<br /><br />Durability was pretty good though they rarely survived a fall. Usually something would break or the screen would crack. Seemed like maybe the screen was a little more susceptible to cracking, but that's a hard one to call as corporate users are not known to be easy on laptops. Home users should experience little trouble with this as long as they take good care of their laptop.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up. If you never have a trackpad issue, you keep your vents clear, and you never need to upgrade it, you should get a very long life out of this laptop.go to sleep, the Wireless drivers would fail and the device would appear to be uninstalled.

(The genuine drives are actually made by PNY under across branding agreement.) See &#34;http://www.pny.com.tw/index.php?mode=product_detail&PID=78&#34; for HP v250w product specifications and check for yourself.<br /><br />In fact, *nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. The top capacity on the market is the 1TB Kingston Predator.<br /><br />Any v250w advertised with a higher capacity is one of many Chinese-made counterfeits that have flooded the market. These counterfeits invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low. Read on...<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back. Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive. To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals. Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient.

I was going to build my own but humans are inherently lazy so looked around for a decent pre-built rig. I looked around at sites such as ibuypower, but I didnt want to spend more than $1500 and I found myself adding too many flashy items to the computer that I wouldnt need. I also wanted something within the next couple days so I started to look at Asus nice I've had one of their laptops now for a couple years and has held up great.<br />Ive been able to run any game in my Steam library at max settings with decent fps, 45+. That includes Skyrim with the graphic enhancing mods, GTAV, and many more. Also played FFXIV with max settings and 60+ fps. If you want to run dual monitors, be warned, the top HDMI and VGA slots are not active. I had to call customer support to figure that out, it was a huge headache trying to figure out why my second monitor wasn't being detected. Thats the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.<br />I would highly recommend disabling windows automatic updates because (as many reviews here have stated) windows and Asus do not get along for some reason. I just downloaded some of the drivers I needed and thats about it...still don't know if I want to upgrade to Windows 10 on here.<br />Overall though, great computer, especially for gaming. It's handled everything I've thrown at it so far with no problems. Oh and the keyboard is pretty neat too.",2015-08-31

I was interested in this case, but after reading the reviews was concerned it might be a little too thick & clunky.  As a result, I ordered a thin smart cover case (Khomo Dual Super Slim) and another rotating case (Fintie) that looked very similar but for considerably less money.<br />My observations:<br />Khomo Dual Slim Case -- for me this was just to thin & did not provide the added protection of the Targus or Fintie. It was a Smart Cover & did put the iPad Air to sleep. If you don't want any bulk & no features except putting your case to sleep, this may work well for you. It has over 10,000 reviews & is well rated, but it's not for me.<br /><br />Fintie 360 Rotating Case -- looks very similar from the outside but clearly did not feel or behave like the Targus rotating case. It felt a bit less heavy and the grooves that allow the tablet to sit in landscape mode were not as deep, not as many grooves, & did not feel as stable in the groove when compared to the Targus. In portrait position, both the Targus & the Fintie are less secure in position when compared to landscape mode. The Fintie  tablet seemed a bit more wobbly in Portrait position than the Targus.  I use Portrait mode mainly for Face-Time.<br /><br />Targus case -- I have used this case for 6 weeks now & am certain I made the best decision for my needs!<br />Sleep mode does not hesitate when you close the cover. I appreciate the elastic band that keeps the case closed. I use a stylus touch pen that has a clip & leash (Friendly Swede available on Amazon) & I clip the pen to the band instead of using the provided sleeve because it's quicker & easier.  I could take or leave the business card holder. I probably would prefer if this feature was omitted and one more groove added.  Since it's there, I find that a business card tends to bend when you try to insert one. My work around is to insert an oldplastic (like credit card) gift card and then put in a couple of business cards on top. It slides easier. I can also insert a small microfiber cloth in- between these cards so it's there when needed.  No difficulty in rotating, although I do steady the tablet when in Portrait mode.  The stitching seems well done, no loose threads noted inside or out.  The corners seem well protected & it's easy to access the volume & power switches as well as charging port.<br />I primarily use Landscape mode & LOVE the fact that the tablet will stay in this position securely while I tap on the keyboard or use gestures on the touch screen. It is rock steady.  For my purposes, it is neither too thick, heavy, or cumbersome.  I appreciate the extra protection for this expensive device!<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this case & would certainly look to Targus for any future cases I may need to purchase.",2015-08-31

If you are going to run hard tubing with this or any other combination of the AX series be ready to exchange rads several times before finding one without defect because if you wait longer than the return policy here on Amazon allows XSPC support will claim that their bad QC is an industry standard and that it not qualify this radiator for an RMA. The issue here is that the built in ports on this and my AX360 rads are in a angle. Why would that be a problem you ask? Well good luck running a straight run out of it into something else. It looks awkward and sometimes just plain not safe since you will be putting a strain on the tubing due to the angle of both fittings not matching. This should be grounds for a RMA but XSPC just plainly told me that it was not and it is quite common defect on rads... Yeah lost all my faith in this guys after that and for now on will move on to another brand. And will always thoroughly check the goods for minor junk like this that can go highly undetected.  My last build I was using some Alphacool Radiators. They performed well but lacked on aesthetics big time. So new build is going to be black and white and this radiators seemed to be the perfect fit. Whey I opened the box I was amazed. The radiator just feels like a top end product. The build quality, the painting, the connectors... I don't care if they wont perform as well. This things are amazing. Highly recommend it. Got this 360 and one 240. Once the build is done I will update the review to include the picture.",2015-08-31

I've plugged it in to charge via USB perhaps twice since I bought it - but only because I thought it felt neglected, not because the rechargable battery actually ran out of juice!  It powers on and pairs quickly with hardly a hesitation. It's nice to be able to press a keyboard hot-button to switch instantly from typing on my Windows tablet, to type something on my iPhone, and right back again. I'd highly recommend this keyboard for anyone who finds themselves on the go with a tablet computer.",2015-08-31

The keys have just the right amount of clickiness and resistence. It is not hard to press the keys, but the pressure makes for accuracy of keystrokes. The keys, themselves are molded, and not smooth, flat, lifeless, like a mac keyboard or many laptop keyboards are. This, too, increases accuracy. I rarely make typing mistakes on this keyboard.

If I had to use some unit to say how thin it is, it is essentially the thinnest sleeve zip up binder type of covering out there, you know the offbrand ones that arent from Mead Five Star etc.",2015-08-31

Over the years I have tried triple monitor setups, 30&#34; 1600p monitors, widescreen TV's and even an 34&#34; ultrawide monitor @ 3440x1440 and this is the better than all of them. This has the height and width that really sucks you in and immerses you in whatever you are doing on it. The image quality is great for this large of a display size, text is perfectly legible, no fuzziness or distortion which I guess can be a problem with the smaller 4K monitors, dunno never tried a smaller 4K monitor just went for it with this one. Lots of display real estate for productivity and huge visuals for gaming. Setting it up to run 4K at 60hz was easy using a Geforce 980 ti card and performance it very sweet, if your graphics card can do Display Port 2.0 you are golden.<br /><br />Now the cons, colors and the stand. The colors seemed a bit washed out and needed a bit tweaking to get a bit more vibrance out of them, but it was easy to correct. The stand is the worst part, I really don't care for it; it has a strange angled design that just feels odd, also there is no tilt ability on the stand which is very inflexible. I feel like the stand could have been designed much better to suit this great display more appropriately.<br /><br />Ultimately I love this display enough that I can't take any stars off for the cons because they just don't matter that much in relation to how much I am enjoying this display.",2015-08-31

So I saved time by connecting another USB device to the computer, backing up to it, and then backing that up to the Seagate device using it's built in USB.

Before this router we had an old linksys which, while it worked well, did not provide us with the speed and range that we wanted. One day while perusing amazon for alternatives I stumbled onto this one. Oh how happy I was to have something that offered the ability to stream Netflix without issue and allowed my son to use the Xbox without lag. After setting it up with a unique username and password and connecting our myriad devices to our new wifi we were off... That is until the day I tried to log into my wifi settings and happened upon someone else's router settings. Imagine my surprise when I logged into the settings to find none of my own devices, no gaming systems, smart phone or laptops, but rather those belonging to someone else. I touched nothing in the way of settings and logged out and once again tried to log into my settings. Nothing. No interface, not even a login window. I tried to reset the router to factory settings and after it power cycled it was if nothing had happened, all the settings that should have been wiped out were still there. My phone connected, along with the rest of the wifi devices that litter my house, yet I still couldn't log into my router settings.<br /><br />It was at that point that I called the Asus component help line. I phone number that, while offering that ability to speak with someone, offered little in the way of any help. After an hour on the phone with some man who spent more time yelling and interrupting me then offering assistance, I hung up vowing never again to call that number. That was months ago... and while I have been monitoring my network to ensure that no one was making unauthorized use of my internet with a 3rd party program, it was bothersome that I could not access my network settings.<br /><br />My plan to never again contact the Asus help line was working well, up to today when I realized that I needed to connect a new network camera to our home network, and hoping that last time was a fluke I decided to chance another call. This time around the experience was better...to begin with. The helpful gentleman was quick to assess my problem, a non-functioning reset button. He assured me that everything would be taken care of and that I would be receiving a new router shortly, stating that he only needed to place me on a brief hold to finish processing the RMA.<br /><br />After a few short minutes Lee, that was his name, joined my back on the phone saying that unfortunately to process the RMA I would first need to ship my current router back, and that it would take anywhere from a week or two to receive my new, hopefully functional router. It seems ridiculous that in a world in which the internet is now required for school (both my wife and sons respective schools require them to have internet access to turn in homework assignments and papers) and work that the removing ones ability to access the internet is something that a company deems acceptable. I voiced my concern to Lee, who to his credit did his best to see that my concerns were mollified, and he transferred me to someone claiming to be a specialist. When I explained to her that it is impossible for my household to make due without access to school websites since my wife's college classes make use of online exams and my son's school requires homework to be done on an iPad and submitted electronically (an issue for another time) she told me that while there has been an outcry for an advanced refunding process for routers, Asus would be unable to assist me in my request, I was flabbergasted. It seems absurd to me that a company, any company, would be deaf to the request of there clientele, and more so when that company is located in the tech sector with global reach (what would they do without internet for a week? I realize that the comparison is one of a hyperbolic nature, but the point remains in a world were many make their living in a home office a week or two without access to the internet could have a devastating effect on there income). I was informed that while their motherboard department was afforded the luxury of sending working replacements before receiving the defective product, that an arbitrary line in the sand had been drawn and on this side there was nothing to be done.<br /><br />I was appalled. After having spend a small fortune on various Asus products over the past five to ten years on products that range from monitors to motherboards I was offered little more then a cold shoulder. I have had various other problems with other hardware purchased for computers; some faulty hard drives, ram and motherboards from other companies, and in every other situation the RMA has been handled after working replacements have arrived at my door step. The customer service I was provided was anything but customer orientated. Since I now need a new router, it looks like I will be looking at Asus's competitors for both my immediate and future hardware needs.et could have a devastating effect on there income).

The keyboard however, is a catastrophe.  There is considerable input lag in the keyboard even if it is located close to the wireless usb. Sometimes the keystrokes aren't even recognized. If the keystrokes DO manage to get picked up by the usb receiver, there is also a chance that keystrokes are typed twice from one press of a key. Really annoying.  *UPDATE* September 18, 2015 So Anker customer support emailed me and said they would ship me another mouse and keyboard combo and stated that the first one I previously got was faulty. The new mouse and keyboard they sent me works fine for now. I haven't experienced any aggravating factors such as double inputs on the keyboard. The range is a lot better than the first one I got as well. I don't need to use a usb extension cord anymore in order to stay within 1 foot of the wireless usb. So far I'm happy with it. It is how I would expect a wireless keyboard and mouse to perform. Hopefully the quality of this keyboard won't decline in the near future.",2015-08-31

(I managed to get a $4 discount at the register.)  I bought this as a Wi-Fi adapter for my 2006 Mac Pro so that I wouldn't have to install an Airport card, which is not easy.   Long story short, I went to my nearest brick and mortar stores to find this item. All I found at the first place were various expensive Netgear adapters with no OSX support. Then I left and went next door and found a plethora of other adapters. I came across this particular D-Link AC600 adapter - it happened to be the cheapest, smallest, and had dual band (2.4 and 5 gHz) support built into it.  Even though no Apple support is stated on the box, I decided to research it - I searched online and actually found a software driver for it on D-Link's website supporting OSX (http://www.dlink.com/uk/en/support/product/dwa-171-wireless-ac-dual-band-usb-adapter). I bought it and took it home.  The first night of purchase, I installed the drivers and plugged in the the adapter. A program called &#34;Wireless AC - Network Utility&#34; popped up upon restart and started working to find available signals. The program has a LOT of options and tabs, but is straight forward enough. I found my router name and put in the WPA2 security information - the program will automatically save a profile for the router. After another few moments, I was able to access the internet. However, I had to enter the security information a couple more times after restarting the computer until the program saved it automatically. Since then, the program opens and runs on autopilot upon start up and gets a wireless connection fairly quickly. It will run quietly in the background and doesn't use many resources.  My signal strength fluctuates between 85 - 100%, but the connection is very stable. I normally use my desktop for uploading pictures, streaming HD video and movies, checking email, misc. browsing,and mass downloading (usually GB's at a single time). The D-Link AC600 has given me NO problems so far.  Pros: - Good price - Dual band support - Low profile (small) - Support for old versions of OSX (I'm running 10.6.8) - Has good range and connection stability - USB plug n' play  Cons: - Sticky driver installation and initial set-up  - Not the cheapest dongle  - No obvious Apple or Linux support stated on box; I had to do a thorough search online to find the appropriate drivers   - D-Link has a mixed reputation  I hope this review helps out some people.",2015-08-31

I contacted Acer and they directed me to their 3rd party assistance and the man on the phone told me to &#34;go to staples. They can help you fix it.&#34; IF I WANTED TO GO TO STAPLES I WOULD HAVE CALLED STAPLES! I called Acer to get assistance from Acer.

Here's what I've found so far.<br /><br />1. The cover fits very snugly. If you try to apply the cover too quickly, there will be a lot of air gaps between the cover and the keys. Apply it slowly and go key by key at first. Then it will fit like it's supposed to.<br />2. It does not affect my typing at all. I personally don't find that it is harder whatsoever to type. It definitely does feel different--the keys feel softer--but it does not feel more difficult.<br />3. The keyboard does make louder sounds as I read in a review before I purchased it. At first I thought that sounded crazy--how could a silicone cover make anything louder? But it does. I find that the smaller keys are just a little bit louder, and it's mostly the space bar and other bigger keys that are noticeably louder. This is just in comparison to typing without a cover, though. Compared to other laptops, the keyboard still isn't very loud at all.<br />4. The coloring on my backslash, enter, and shift keys is not exactly perfect as you can see in the fourth picture I included. The rest of the keys look fine, however.<br />5. The letters on the cover do not exactly line up with the letters on the keyboard. The backlight is not quite as effective this way, but it still lights the keyboard up enough to see in the dark. If you don't even use the backlight, this won't be an issue at all because the letters on the cover are clear and look nice.<br />I included pictures to hopefully give a better idea of the color of the red cover. Also, the pictures I took were right after I threw the cover on, and I hadn't yet wiggled it around to get it to fit all the keys. You can see how much air there is under the keys. If you take time and apply the cover correctly, the cover should not look like that at all.<br /><br />TLDR: Overall, satisfied with this product so far. Types well, I love the color. Four stars just because the letters don't line up exactly and I wish they did.<br /><br />UPDATE: After almost a year of having this keyboard cover, it still fits like a charm, it's still a vibrant red, and I'm still very happy with it.'t line up exactly and I wish they did.

The box that the case comes in is a better appraisal of the case stating that it is for a 9 to 9.7 inch tablet.For the LG tablet, the case is about 1/4 inch too narrow and provides no protection for the sides of the tablet.  I might have tolerated the case but it was also defective.  The bluetooth would not connect.  For a smaller tablet, I would say that the case is ideal.  After reporting that the item was defective to Amazon, they contacted the company who immediately sent me an e-mail to make sure I ran through the check list of things to prove that the case was defective.  I told them everything I had tried and they immediately gave me full credit for the item and said to not send it back to them.  That is what I call great customer service and has resulted in my changing the review from 2 to four stars.

To balance that 2GB of RAM out, you're only given a 32GB SSD so storage is nonexistant. I had initially bought this computer to install Kali Linux on it and use it for penetration testing. I bought it with no accessories for dirt cheap, not realizing that in order to get a charger for it, I had to order it right through Asus for $40. If you buy it and need a new charger, screen, keyboard, etc. tough s***. You are SOL. Also, the device's BIOS does not support booting to an external device so installing Linux is 100% impossible on this.

I like to use them to accent the trees and bushes around the house. Not only does it look nice when you have accent lighting shining on some of the larger trees and shrubs around your home, but it makes it a bit harder from someone to use that area to hide from view, so there is less of a chance of a break in.<br /><br />This light is very nice. The solar panel is close to 3.5\\"" x 6\\"" in size. There are two plastic thumbscrews so you can adjust and angle the light and the solar panel. Included are 3 screws and 3 plastic wall anchors for attaching to the wall. However if I were to attach this light to the wall I think I would use different screws and wall anchors, the ones included don't look very strong to me.<br /><br />Also included is a plastic ground stake. I prefer using the stake, I change my mind a lot and move the lights in our yard around quite a bit. The ground stake just connects below the light so you can stick it into the ground or inside a potted plant. Just make sure that the solar panel is in the sun so the light can continue to charge up during the day.<br /><br />The button on the back of the panel allows you to turn the light on and off, and choose between high and low for the lighting. Very simple to use. This light is not smooth around the light like the other ones we have, this one has ribs going around the light and small cut out areas around the edge. It looks nice but for me I think I prefer the smoother style the best. We get spiders here like you wouldn't believe and they just love little hidey holes to crawl into, plus any dirt that splashed up when you water or when it rained would collect there as well if you are using the ground stake.<br /><br />On a full charge you can get close to around 6-9 hours of light. I double checked last night and the light turned on when the light started fading outside and when I went to bed a bit after midnight it was still going strong. The light was still lit when my husband woke up for work at 3 A.M.  It looks very nice in our yard, I love being able to use sunlight instead of having to wire outdoor lighting!<br /><br />Free product sample received for review purposes.till going strong.

I wanted it to be compatible with their ultra current laptops required by their school of engineering, and I liked the idea of a combined cable modem and router from a convenience standpoint. Initially, during setup, I experienced problems in the setup, since I did not &#34;reset&#34; the unit first to factory specs. Since it was already used previously (I bought this as a used unit on Amazon.com at an excellent price), the former owner had set a unique log-in and password, and did not inform me what they were. But once I reset the box to factory specs, then the initial setup proceeded well and smoothly.<br /><br />After setup, one of my son's laptop was experiencing random disconnects from the internet which was very frustrating. The connection would come and go, and when it went, you would see a yellow exclamation mark on the internet icon in the task bar of the laptop screen in the lower right hand side. But then the laptop would just automatically reconnect to the internet again, and then the random disconnect process would begin again. The other son's laptop would lose connection to the wireless HP Officejet printer. In his case, we would have to &#34;reload&#34; the massive drivers again in his laptop over and over to get the connection reestablished, and then randomly, the problem would appear again. But his laptop (which is identical in model, hardware and specifications to the other son's) would never lose connection with the internet.<br /><br />After much diagnosis and stepwise problem solving, we realized that the sons were living in a high density student environment and that there were many separate internet networks active in the same building and nearby, with many of them operating on the same WiFi channels. In our location, these tended to be channels 11 and 6. Our own modem router defaulted to channel 11.<br /><br />This Arris modem router has a feature once you enter the program inside the modem router to fine-tune it, that allows you to conduct a channel scan of your environment, and allows you then to select a unique default channel other than 11, 6, or 1.  We chose channel 9 since no one else was using that channel. Once we did that, then the separate problems each of the two laptops were experiencing went away, and now the laptops have been continuously connected to both the internet and to the printer as well without dropouts.<br /><br />So, the takeaway we learned was to get to know our living environment well first, and then to fine-tune the WiFi operating channel  that would avoid competing channel traffic from surrounding networks in our location. Once we did that, our dropped internet connection and dropped printer WiFi connection problems went away.<br /><br />Setup with Comcast internet cable was easy and straightforward, and we were able to activate that modem router easily using the Comcast Xfinity set up program. It was straightforward and automatic, and we are now pleased overall with the Arris SBG6782-AC modem router!",2015-08-31

As I favor a cloning solution, I need the flexibility that a blank hard drive brings; a ten second Quick Format took care of placing my 'solution' onto my new hard drive.<br /><br />Given that the new drive serves as a clone backup, file transfer rates varied all over the place, from 150 Kb/second for copying thousands of very high resolution photographs, to cruising at close to 19 Mb/second for generic text files. Throughout the cloning operation the drive never felt warm, running a pretty constant 37° C compared to the internal HDD @ 42° C. The included USB 3 cord is definitely short, being long enough to reach from the top of the drive over and down the front and into a USB 3 hub stationed next to my Acer Aspire 111-E3 ultraportable.<br /><br />Good flexibility, available software tools & cloud storage, a 2 year warranty (twice the normal coverage), and the lowest price for a 1 TB drive I found on Amazon, equals a good bargain. I took off one star for the very short USB cord and the difficulty of getting into the box (a royal pain, requiring cutting). Overall, a very satisfied customer.",2015-08-31

While I had my clinic wired to accept multiple TVs, I never got around to it, and technology has caught up so that portable DVD players are no longer needed.<br /><br />WHERE CORNERS WERE CUT<br />Aesthetics - It's kinda heavy, which doesn't bother me, but the buttons are all on one end and not intuitive<br />Form - I can only see that one particular cover fits it completely, and it has mixed reviews.<br />Camera - It's horrible. That's all I can say about it. Just horrible.<br />OS - Their version of Android leaves out what are normally standard features. For example, I was shocked to find that there is no way to set up user accounts. I had planned on setting the tablet up as the administrator/owner, and creating a &#34;Guest&#34; or &#34;Patient&#34; account with limited access. That way I could leave it with someone for 15 minutes, and trust that person would not (accidentally or otherwise) end up on inappropriate websites, in the middle of my email, or on our clinic server. My choices are to root it, or to get a child protection app. It also (as far as I can tell so far) as no automatic setting for screen brightness. Given these two big omissions in their build of the OS, I'm assuming that there are going to be other things missing that I will find over the next couple of weeks. There were default settings which were out of the norm, like having the microphone (for speech dictation) not set to appear in the keyboard by default. I had to search around the internet to find out how to get it put back where it has been on every other Android device I've ever used.<br /><br />WHERE IT PERFORMS ACCEPTABLY<br />Screen - For my uses and for theprice, it was acceptable.<br />Speed - It handles large picture files, movies (on the device and streaming) and all the apps I use perfectly well and smoothly.<br />Overall build - Seems good so far. The touch screen works and is just sensitive enough. I don't think it has the &#34;hover&#34; capability like my phone does though.<br /><br />After installation of &#34;Kids Place&#34; and an app to allow full screen pictures, I think that it will do what I needed it to do. If not, it will be my toy for Facebook, light email, light reading, and quick searches while hanging out around the house.

The feet on the bottom portion of the case were also in place this time, unlike the for the first case I received. Needless to say, I was very impressed by the second case. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the logo was on the top portion of the case. In short, great case the second time around. I would recommend purchasing a standard black case.<br /><br />09-09-15 (Original Review): The case looked and felt very cheap, so I returned it.

I was going to give it four stars, but that would just be insulting. There is only one downfall to this tablet, but once you know the way to deal with it, then you're left with a great great tablet!<br /><br />I'll address the issue right away to get it out of the way. This tablet has problems with updating and resetting. Whenever you go to perform one of these system tasks the tablet will begin the process normally, but then it will end up with a black screen. Now when people see black screens they tend to panic, I personally tried to turn on the tablet because I had thought it was finished, but it wasn't! This causes many issues and can brick your tablet, I luckily got mine to turn on again. The trick is that you have to leave your tablet on and plugged in, and even when you see the black screen don't do anything because it will eventually turn on with all the the updates installed. So to summarize if you go to update or refresh, sit by your tablet, have it plugged in and just wait for the black screen to pass because that is when the tablet is working. At the end you will see the tablet turn on to your lock-screen.<br /><br />Once you figure update anything that you have to then you can finally enjoy the amazing tablet. I want to start out by saying that for a hundred bucks you get so much more than I would have expected. I will start off with the build. The back of the tablet has very small ridges, but this allows for some added grip. Around the body of the tablet you will find a micro usb port, a headphone jack and your micro sd card slot. The micro sd card is very welcomed as there is only around 2.5gb of usable space when you get the tablet. On top of the great ports and feel it has a very sturdy construction so feel free to toss it in your bag and bring it around with you.<br /><br />Now on to the use of the tablet. When you're navigating the tablet it is extremely speedy! This tablet has never stuttered on me or slowed down. Now you obviously can't do anything to intensive on it like video editing, but basic tasks it handles with ease and speed! It can even do some light gaming, like Asphalt and other similar games from the Windows Store. The display on it makes the overall experience even better! It has great colors and no back-light bleed. Even though it is lower resolution the tablet still has a pretty sharp screen, whether you're watching movies, playing games, or surfing the web it provides a great viewing experience.<br /><br />Overall this is a great tablet for both pleasure and productivity. I highly recommend it as it is very fast and overall a pleasure to use.<br /><br />~I was provided a free sample in exchange for an unbiased review~ng to intensive on it like video editing, but basic tasks it handles with ease and speed!

But my particular experience with this 8TB drive bears reporting and is why I give it only 1 star.<br /><br />I bought 2 of these 8TB drives, here, in late March of 2015, brand new. One was for backup of the other. The drives were on a table top and never moved. The primary drive was used heavily most days, with many concurrent reads and writes, and synced up to the secondary drive at night. Both drives were safely detached and powered down each night, until used again.<br /><br />One morning last August 2015, when I connected the primary drive to my computer, Windows suddenly now says it is seeing a &#34;ASMT 2115&#34; USB Device. In Disk Manager, this drive shows 3 partitions, 1 raw and 2 unallocated -- instead of the single NTFS partition I had in place.  I've never ever seen this kind of thing before, but a google search did report that others have had a similar situation before with other Seagate drives, but the contexts were different from mine and in the end, I could find no definitive explanation or remedy. Neither could Seagate. A senior Seagate tech person  came on to my machine remotely and we tried a number of things but the result was the same: No explanation, no solution, the drive data is lost. I returned the drive and they sent me a NEW replacement.<br /><br />THAT WAS THE FIRST DRIVE. Now, 4 months later the 2nd drive from this same order, which I had since made the primary heavily accessed drive, fails to connect to my computer. Different problem from the first drive: This one shows up in Devices & Printers and Device Manager as Backup+ Desk, but does NOT show up at all in Disk Manager - so it's not an issue of it being offline. Again, Seagate sent me a NEW replacement.<br /><br />So those are the facts of my experience with this drive. It's probably and hopefully a very rare isolated problem.  The serial number of this drive shared the first 7 of 8 chars with thefirst drive, ending in &#34;R&#34; while the first one ended in &#34;Q&#34; so I assume they were manufactured at the same time. Seagate would not confirm, but I suspect there were problems with the earlier production runs of this 8TB drive and I got stuck with lemons.  For one thing --- Seagate does NOT normally ship NEW drives as replacements even in warranty.<br /><br />One other problem that costs a star in my rating is that this drive cannot be used to with Windows 7 system image creation. You get a I/O error early on in the process. The same with the Seagate 5TB drives.",2015-08-31

I've only been using it for about two weeks, though not every day (I teach online classes). Perhaps it's like a new pair of shoes that may feel tight at first but that become more comfortable with time. I don't have a large head, so your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I'm so far very impressed with the sound quality, including that of the mic, especially at this price point.

It's the only Mac in the house (all of the rest of us have PCs). When I do use it, I try to keep it in a secure location- but occasionally I'm toting it somewhere and I want it to be in a case. I have a very simple bohemian style, and because of this I want accessories that kind of fit with what I wear. This neutral gray felt fabric with the leather accent was perfect in terms of appearance- so I thought I'd try it out.<br /><br />The bag itself is very well-sewn. I do think it will hold up for quite some time. Because it's felt material it does provide a sense of cushion to it that will keep your Macbook safe. That's something I really liked about this bag. The inside of the bag is mold-proof and wear-resistant. It does seem like very high quality fabric and I don't think it will wear out any time soon. With that being said, there are a few issues I had with the outer fabric. The first is that I'm not entirely sure how to wash it? In a house full of children, things naturally get dirty and I try to get things that are made of materials that can be washed. I'm not sure if this one can be. It also has a very 'scratchy' texture to it, that picks up cat hair very easily. We have two cats, so that's something that I immediately noticed.<br /><br />It fits the Macbook Air perfectly and does hold everything securely inside. I feel a lot better carrying it around in this case than I did shoving it in a non-fitted bag. It looks very pretty and as it describes in the product description it does have a very 'British simplistic' appearance to it, which can fit virtually any style. It'd make a great gift for college students and business persons alike.<br /><br />It also comes with a small bag which I thought was a great added bonus. I can keep my USB, camera cord, small notebook, and pens in the littler pouch- and it matches the big pouch, which is just very cool.<br /><br />Overall, a great bag. Not sure how to wash it and the fabric does grip to pet hair. But it's very durable, made of high quality fabrics, and well-sewn. It'll definitely do its job of holding my Macbook secure while I travel.wash it and the fabric does grip to pet hair. But it's very durable, made of high quality fabrics, and well-sewn.

I chose it over the battle-tested Arris models because it was a good price for a future-proof modem. Who knows, someday maybe Comcast will have gigabit over DOCSIS.<br /><br />One of the neat secrets is that XFINITY actually provisions a slightly higher speed than the advertised tier, in part to allow bursting to a higher speed at the start of a download. This modem allowed me to take advantage of that. Even though the rep told me my Blast package is &#34;up to 105 Mbps&#34; down, it's actually at &#34;up to 150 Mbps&#34; in this area, and my speed test when connected directly by Gigabit Ethernet to this cable modem reached 178 Mbps.

The UI is pretty standard for Cisco/Linksys devices - if you've used any of their other products, it will probably look familiar - and is not difficult to use.

Needing to replace a Nexus battery before all the boxes can be unpacked, this low-priced seemed worth the risk. While I did replace the battery, it was touch and go at times.<br /><br />The driver heads are dicy during operation, the material is thin and not a perfect head shape. Using the phillips on a particularly tight screw when the driver slipped it became clear that the screwdriver would strip/break/deform ridiculously quick, Breaking tips/bits is always a risk, particularly in this gage range, but these are begging to break.<br /><br />The mount bars ended up being single use. After 5-10 movements the plastic was showing signs of fatigue. One ripped partially by the end of the battle to release the old battery from it's glue. A battle exasperated by the fact that the tip ( the end thins and then has a 120 degree bend )  of the mount bar instantly bent to the pressure exerted easily folding on the natural seam.<br /><br />The paddles were okay, and they'll live to see another operation. I didn't use any of the other tools, but I would expect similar experiences with them.<br />These got the job done although it took 3x as long. The tools really needed a delicate touch and I wasn't trying to have a disassembled phone.<br /><br />If I don't find my missing set I'll be buying a formal replacement, unfortunately these are disposable tools  - and that's just sad.

I'm technically competent enough to understand router technologies. Linksys has either idiots on the Technical Support for this router or the router has some serious design flaws.<br />I bought one from amazon and don't have any issue with them. BUT, after several lengthy conversations, the only way they determined that could resolve my problem was to send a replacement. Replacement has the same issue - consistent speed problems that kept my iMac at about 30mbps with a speed out of my Motorola cable modem in the 90mbps. I run an iMac A7 which screams and needs the more bandwidth than this router can provide. Only other item running through the router is an iPad OR my wife's Dell laptop. Finally replaced with a Netgear product that works like a champ. STAY AWAY from this router if you need a WiFi Router that works at higher speeds.",2015-08-31

My Samsung Galaxy S5 and a Lenovo tablet barely charged at all, even when plugged in separately to either of two different Anker chargers with these cables. The charging was so weak the phone actually used more power than was added when the screen was in use while charging. Also, the connector on one of them became loose from its housing and did not maintain a steady connection without being placed in a certain position. However, the same chargers work fine with the equivalent Cable Matters cables in white, as well as with iPhones and iPads on Cable Matters lightning cables in both black and white. That leads me to believe it is just these cables that have the issues.<br /><br />Those things being said, the company sent replacement cables with no hassle. When those did not work any better, they ultimately issued a refund. I would give the cables themselves a 1 star rating and the customer service a 4 or 5, so a 3 seems generous given I still need to find cables that actually work.",2015-08-31

My older desktop used to take a good 2 minutes to boot. And then logging into Windows 10 would grind along loading background apps for another couple of minutes. All the while, negatively affecting what I was trying to do. Now, the PC boots in 7 seconds. And when the Windows desktop appears, it's ready to roll.<br /><br />The migration software worked well. I had to get the contents of my 1 TB drive pared back to bare minimum (about 40 GB) to get the migration software to move the Windows operating system to the smaller SSD drive. So while the migration software will allow you to bypass some media files (music, videos, etc.), it doesn't offer the ability to pick and choose folders and files for migration.<br /><br />Here is what I did to get a clean set up: I backed up my data. I performed a factory restore of my desktop (the OS was re-installed onto the 1 TB HDD with no applications or data files). Total space used was about 40 GB. I connected the new Samsung SSD to that desktop with a SATA-to-USB cable (essentially like an external drive) and used an available power plug from the desktop PC. I used Samsung's migration software to move the Windows operating system to the SSD. I installed the SSD into the desktop PC (connecting the SATA cable to the motherboard). I disconnected the original 1 TB HDD to ensure Windows would boot from the SSD. It booted into Windows from the SSD. Windows was still activated (recognized as genuine by Microsoft). My PC originally shipped with Windows 8, so I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and then to Windows 10. At each point, Windows remained activated. With that completed, I connected my original HDD and use it for media and data files (you would need to get Windows off the original HDD, but I won't go on and on about doing that here when a Web search can spell out how to do this).<br /><br />NOTE: Each time I connected/disconnected power to a hard drive, I performed this action when the desktop PC was powered off.<br /><br />I can easily recommend this Samsung SSD. It offers a terrific warranty, and the drive provides enormous performance gains for Windows and my installed applications.sktop PC was powered off.<br /><br />I can easily recommend this Samsung SSD.

This is the 4th year i am buying this brand.  However, there really is no need to buy new every year since they hold up and quality of product is OUTSTANDING!  i buy new because my 9 year old boy looks forward to choosing the photo on the back for back to school.  the product is extremely well made for a rough and tough boy!  the handle,  zipper and shoulder straps are heavy duty.  The only down fall this year for me is i think the bag got smaller - we have to squeeze his cloth-like lunch bag in with his mandatory 3 ring binder and no room for anything else.  but other than that - i love this bag and will continue to buy year after year.  the price is well worth the hold up of this bag. you will not be disappointed. (however-i suggest they come up with some sort of freshener within the lining of the bag if you have a stinky kid! lol)<br />*****UPDATE  - it is Feb 2016 (i bought this bag in Aug 2015) - so far, the zipper handle broke off, the handle on top came apart from the seams and now the straps on the back at the seams are coming off the back pack.  i'm saddend and shocked to see how this bag is NOT holding up. the previous years the bag was great...now we switched to last years backpack for the remainder of this school year. boo. go back to the original quality!!!",2015-08-31

No worries about that though.  You won't have any trouble finding places to mount HDD'ss because you can order a part from Rosewill to add 6 (I believe) internal storage bays.<br /><br />All in all, I love this case.

(easy to fix though... read On)","Ok.. I purchased 4 of these in late. They work well, I had them on 24/7 under pretty heavy loads, no issues just plug them in and go. Now it is Aug 2015 by this time 3 of the 4 have failed. Out of warranty of course.  All with the same simptoms. I should have trashed the first 2 but for some reason I just labeled them as bad and put them on the parts shelf.<br /><br />In a past life I was an electronic tech and when this last one went, I decided to take a look at them since each one seemed to fail in the exact same way.  The first 2 within weeks of each other. They just simply stopped working all the standard port lights were out. But the 2 SFP and the power light were on solid. A recycle of the power (unplug - plug) did not change anything. This made me think it had to be a common component that was failing and I might be able to eyeball it.<br /><br />Clearly they were not production quality and never could be trusted again but maybe they would be good in a pinch if I needed a switch but did not have a good replacement on hand.<br /><br />Once I opened them up, what I found on for all 3 of the failed switches was that there were bloated capacitors on the power supply(PS). So I took a look at the output of the PS on one of them and it was 4.3vdc but the PS was labeled as 5v. I scrounged up some replacement caps. and replaced them. It was pretty easy to do, just desolder the old caps and put in the new ones of the same or better ratings. I put them in and tested. All fixed up.<br /><br />Next I ordered a few more caps from Amazon. [[ASIN:B00CD1ECYO Bluecell pack of 20, 16V 1000uF 105c High Temperature Radial Leads Replacement Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitor]] and fixed the other 2.<br /><br />You can see in the close up of the PS where the 3 closest Caps are all bulging at the top. and the ones in the back are flat. That is a sure sign of a cap that has seen better days. The other pics are just a good look at the inners of the switch. Note there are no fans. I also include 2 pics of one of the bad caps I removed.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone that might be thinking of purchasing theses.

The fact that I can even just put my phone in the trench to simply hold it up in front of me while I'm working on my work computer, is fantastic.

Honestly, the bluetooth connection for all the devices I connected was extremely easy and I didn't have any trouble re-connecting with each device, even if I didn't use the keyboard with that device for a while.<br /><br />The keyboard is a great size, has all the keys you need, but is still small and doesn't take much room (it doesn't show Pg Up/Down or Home/End keys on the arrow keys, but those functions work with those keys). It's hardy and well built, so I never had to worry about it falling apart on me, even when I tossed it into my laptop bag without anything protecting it.<br /><br />I absolutely adore this keyboard for size, number of buttons available for a small keyboard, and ease of use and connection and switching between devices. The ONLY thing that basically ruined this keyboard for me is the sound of the keys. At times, I'd be on the phone with people and typing away and they would ask me if I was on a typewriter!! Not that it's really that loud, but clearly loud enough to get people to comment on it. When I moved from a louder, busier office to a smaller, much quieter office, the sound of my keyboard was all anyone could hear and it just irritated the entire office, so I had to replace it with something quieter (which really broke my heart, because I LOVE this thing!!).<br /><br />If you don't mind the sound, this is an amazing keyboard.

Aside from that, it does a wonderful job of amplifying the speed and reception of the wi fi signal originating from a front house router.

The other great thing about the design is how it manages thermals more on that bellow<br />- Performance, This is the best card I have ever used, great frame rates in all the latest games, that whole arkham knight fiasco everyone is crying about, I barely noticed any issues while playing the game maxed with this card.<br />- Thermals, This card is a beast at staying cool, the great thing is when the card is under 60 degrees Celsius the fans stay at 0 RPM meaning this card has great passive cooling! as long as the airflow in your case is good you should have no problem with fan noise from this card, heck even when the fans turn on I cannot hear them over my already quiet case fans.<br /><br />Cons-<br />- Size: This card is long and tall! This was not a problem for me in particular due to my case but if you do plan on getting this card definitely research its dimensions and the dimensions of your case before purchase.<br />- Power LED, Now normally I loved any type of LED indicator on a variety of things put ASUS decided to put a power LED right where the 8-Pin power connector is, the horrid part of this is its a super bright white LED, highly distracting in a case with a side panel window, I had to use a piece of electrical tape to cover it up<br /><br />All in all a great card for anyone looking for a quiet mid-tier gaming card.",2015-08-31

He spent some time with this Poin2 Chromebook and ended up being very impressed. It's very stylish cover has a texture. It looks durable with metal inside. The 11.6&#34; HD screen is very sharp and &#34;non-glare&#34;--unlike the overly reflective shine of our Mac. Definitely, it brings really good value for cost.<br /><br />Since we already have a google account (guest log-in is possible, but is highly restrictive), it was very easy to login. We could then access a number of features that allowed us to personalize the computer, take photos with the camera, create documents/spreadsheets/slides, retrieve additional apps...In many ways, the set-up reminded us of a big Android Pad with an additional built-in keyboard.<br /><br />The Poin2 Chromebook has no disk drive, making it very light and portable. For this reason, my husband prefers using it to quickly get online and walk around the house using our Wi-Fi. The speed is there--this Chromebook is very responsive.<br /><br />It has all the necessary ports/slots: One for a Micro SD, one for HDMI, two USBs (chargeable 2.0 and 3.0) and an earset/ headset jack. The sound is GREAT--it beats out our old Macbook Pro. Since we already have an HDMI cable, we can readily hook this up to our television to stream movies/ TV shows on a much larger screen.",2015-08-31

At least once a week, it encounters a problem and shuts down while I have important things open that I'm working on (this has been happening since I got it from the box).  This is probably the biggest issue.  Besides that, several drivers have had to be reinstalled since I bought it, just a few months ago.  The touchscreen is really too heavy for the keyboard, and as a result it tends to fall backward on any soft surface (like my lap), and is very tippy on hard surfaces too.  The touchscreen is okay...but it tends to be a bit &#34;sticky&#34;.  It's not glass like most smartphones are, so my finger tends to drag and leave smudges much more easily, and after a while of using it, the touchscreen gets jumpy and buggy because of this.  It also makes it hard to be precise with the touchscreen.  The power button is quite difficult to use as well - sometimes if it's on sleep, I press it and the computer comes back immediately.  Other times, I press it and nothing happens after a few moments, so I end up pressing it a few times trying to make it come back to life and the computer inevitably ends up restarting itself (again a pain).  Also, and this is such a tiny issue, but has bugged me - about two weeks after I got it, one of the rubber feet fell off the bottom, so now it's a bit lopsided, even though it's still quite new.  All in all, this is just not HP's best offering at all.",2015-08-31

However, it was either deleted or I have a bad memory (but I remember the review pretty vividly and I was even contacted by the manufacturer.) In any case, when I first got this adapter, I was using it with my Early 2014 MacBook Air running Yosemite to support a second monitor, my first being the Apple Thunderbolt Display. Using the USB port was the only option. It worked well enough to not return but there were two issues. One, there were display distortions I'd describe as a ghosting effect; a gray colored thin bar running parallel to the right edge of any window. I believe this was a known issue as the driver page mentioned &#34;minor&#34; distortions with Macs. Two, there was a several-second lag when using Mission Control, both going into and out of it. It was quite annoying, but Cable Matters sent me a second adapter to verify it wasn't h/w related. Unfortunately, that one had the same issues.<br /><br />I just updated to El Capitan and when I installed the drivers found that there was a newer version: 2.5 (I was running 2.4 on Yosemite.) I'm glad to say that both problems appear to be resolved. I can't confirm which it was: the OS X update, the drivers, or both, but I'm happy with it.

The shoulder strap falls off continuously. The silver ring it straps on with is held up in a strange way.

I am happy to report that it works VERY well with the Chromebook Flip, and I assume, most other Chromebooks with Bluetooth.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Connects quickly and reliably.  I turn the mouse off to save the battery when I put it in my bag and it still connects in seconds when it is turned back on.<br />- Good quality feel and button response, typical of Logitech products.  Wheel works well, and the left and right tilt buttons perform back and forward on the Chromebook.<br />- The Windows button brings up the Chromebook search / launcher - happy surprise here<br />- Looks - The shiny metallic look of the mouse is very nice.<br />- Bluetooth range - tested up to about 36 feet with the Chromebook Flip<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Nothing to speak of.  Wish it came with a carrying case, but am using an older Logitech pouch that works perfectly well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice mouse to use with a Chromebook or any device, and I expect it will last for many years.",2015-08-31

At the expo I had the opportunity to try Reds, Blues and Browns side by side. Obviously I preferred the Reds. They offer a solid but effortless stroke with just a tiny amount of play and no additional feedback.<br /><br />By far the best feature about this keyboard, and the main reason I bought it, is the the fully flat key bed. Key beds with pockets or indentations collect dust and hair and food particles. We've all seen it, right? When you invert your keyboard, suddenly your desk is showered with keyboard shmung!? This keyboard has no such pockets or indentations, it's fully flat right up to the base of the plungers, so there's almost no where for gunk to get trapped. Such a wonderful feature, you can imagine how easy this keyboard is to keep clean!  And of course the open design looks great too.<br /><br />The palm rest is also quite nice on this board. It has a slightly rubberized surface that isn't spongy but has a little bit of grip to it.<br /><br />Something to note before you buy, this keyboard does require two USB ports. One for data and one for power. Just something to keep in mind in case you're running short on ports.<br /><br />The only real con I can think of is the fact the cable is nondetachable. It's not a deal breaker, but keyboard manufacturers do need to wake up to the fact that, even though we don't often move our keyboards, a detachable cable is extremely useful for cleaning and it makes installing/uninstalling that much easier. So, Corsair, that's my one request... I want a detachable cable on my next $160 keyboard, please! :)",2015-08-31

You do get used to it after a while though.<br />-TARGET software is almost as complicated as it is powerful.<br /><br />And all of those cons are only worth taking one star away.  This is by far the most accurate stick I have ever used, even beating out my old Sidewinder 3D Pro from back when it was brand new.  The fact that it uses hall sensors instead of cheap potentiometers like the Logitech 3D Pro and all of Saitek/MadCatz budget joysticks means this stick should last an extremely long time compared to other sticks in the budget range.<br /><br />If you are looking for a stick, budget or performance, I would highly recommend this.",2015-08-31

"2934","US",17762999,"RP58SNBL1DGRK","B00UB01E8Q",690398846,"Acer Tablet 10.1'' Touch Screen 1.33 GHz Quad-Core 64 GB |SW5-012-13TT (Certified Refurbished)","PC",5,10,10,"N","Y","Best Tablet I've Owned","First, the packaging and the unit are both typical for quality refurbished units.  You should expect minor cosmetic flaws – it’s a refurb unit, but mine is overall very clean.  There is a minor scratch on the keyboard near the right hinge that I can’t see unless I put it under a lamp, and a small dent on the back side of the screen, approximately .5mm deep and 4mm from side to side.  I could do without either of those, but seriously, it’s expected and if you actually use one, you’ll make a few of your own scratches or dents in short order anyway.<br /><br />When I first turned it on I got an error which, from experience, was probably from a failed Win10 upgrade.  I was annoyed that it had been attempted, but the Win8 recovery was automatic - I don’t think I had to hit 2 buttons (there was a recovery partition preinstalled).  That took just a few minutes, and then I was up and running.<br /><br />The keyboard is, as described in other reviews, absolutely top-notch for a tablet.  I’ve tried others, and none have even come close.  If you have giant lumberjack hands, you may have problems with it, but seriously, other than the size which comes with the 10” tablet territory, it’s an absolute dream.  I’m typing this review on a Toshiba Tecra, a $1000+ laptop, and the keyboard response and feedback make it a 10.  I’d give the Acer tablet keyboard a solid 9.<br /><br />The mouse pad is responsive too, but there are no distinctive buttons (they’re there, just below the surface).  Left-clicking can be done anywhere on the pad, but right clicking has taken me a while to get used to.  The pad seems very solid too.<br /><br />Another thing I love, which I have not seen on other tablets I’ve tried, is the strength of the magnets that hold the screen to the keyboard.  You can literally hold it by the screen and shake it, but the keyboard won’t come off.  Somehow though, removal is easy:  open the unit, grasp the corner of the keyboard assembly and the adjacent corner of the screen and kind of rotate the screen off.  It holds when it’s supposed to, and lets go when you want it to.  The variety of screen placement configurations is nice, and that’s one of my favorite things about this tablet – it’s really the best compromise between laptop and tablet I’ve seen.<br /><br />The screen is incredibly sharp.  Colors are vibrant and clarity is impressive.  Speakers are worth noting, as they’re louder than any other tablet I’ve owned.  If you’re planning on watching videos or movies on this unit I think you’ll be quite happy with the audio levels.  If not, there’s an audio port on the left side of the screen.<br /><br />Battery life is also good, just shy of 8 hours of constant normal use.  If you’re thinking of using this as a GPS (which is actually one of the secondary reasons I bought it), you will probably want to get a car charger, though the packaging insert says to let it discharge to 10% before charging, and explicitly warns against overcharging, or leaving it plugged in after it’s charged.  From my experience with these devices, you’ll want to heed that warning.<br /><br />When looking for negatives about this unit, here’s what I come up with.  The USB port is on the keyboard, not on the tablet/screen portion.  I wish it were on the screen.  I don’t expect to use the unit without the keyboard very often, but if you are, plan on not having the USB port with you.<br />However, all other ports are on the screen, including a micro-usb and you can easily plug in a usb adapter cable to it.  Amazon has them here…<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-5in-Micro-Host-Adapter/dp/B00B4GGW5Q/<br /><br />and here…<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters%C2%AE-2-Pack-Micro-USB-Adapter/dp/B00GM0OZ4O/<br /><br />Another thing, and I’m kind of grasping here just to make this review well-rounded, is the way the unit sits on a hard table or desk when it’s opened.  If the unit is in the laptop configuration and opened less than 90 degrees, there’s a wide non-slip pad that holds it to the desk quite well.  But if it’s opened 90 degrees or more, that big pad lifts off the desk and two very small pads take over.  I think they’re more to keep the bottom of the screen hinge from getting scratched though, and they don’t keep it from slipping around.  (Note that this only happens if you're using it like a laptop.  For instance, if you flip the screen around and close it so the back is against the keyboard and the screen is facing up, all the non-slip pads are in place and the thing grips to a desk very very well.)<br /><br />In my opinion this will not be an issue for 99.9% of users.  And the other .1% should just buy a piece of non-slip material to rest it on.  The rest of us will be using this thing on our laps, or sitting on a surface inside a case.  And overall, I think 99% of the people who pick this thing up will love it.quite well.  But if it’s opened 90 degrees or more, that big pad lifts off the desk and two very small pads take over.

I spent a good few minutes trying to pry the Kindle out of the case. I believe the case cracked in the process. So I suppose it's good in the sense that the Kindle is very securely in there and is not at risk of slipping out whatsoever. But I'm still disappointed that the case cracked on the edge. I've had it for less than a month and have never dropped my device. I noticed the crack a few days after attempting to remove the Kindle from the case. Nothing else happened that could explain the crack. Everything else about the case is fine. The magnet keeps the lid closed effectively and also locks/unlocks the Kindle. It's thin and light, making everything easy to carry around. A case simply shouldn't crack in the process of removing the device it is intended to protect. Shouldn't be a problem for most people though, since there is very little reason to take the Kindle out once you put it in the case (I removed mine to get at some dust that fell into the cracks).",2015-08-31

I wound up giving it to someone who assured me they could get it going. Decided to go Frontier's ActionTEC [[ASIN:B00JWUOWDU Actiontec DSL Modem F2250]] modem router, which was working fine. It just did not have the functionality I have been used to over the years with my Netgear Routers, especially the [[ASIN:B00HEX851C Netgear WNDR4500 N900 Dual Band Gigabit Wifi Router]] which I have been using lately in several locations with the USB port & ReadySHARE capability.

Had to reset to factory default in order to connect to it again. I followed the suggestion on Amped's support forum and assigned a static IP address and changed the Channel to 20MHz. This worked........temporarily. But it soon dropped the connection again and I was back to square one. Not to mention changing my router settings created additional problems with my wifi! I highly recommend this extender if you can get it to work. As for me, I replaced it with a Securifi Almond 2015 and have had no problems since.

I would normally not get this rude, but after 45 minutes AFTER the 20 minute wait for them to pickup, I was getting kind of frustrated. Having her ask me to start troubleshooting it from the beginning again was the last straw. &#34;Please unplug all the cables and plug them back in.&#34; Me - &#34;Are you sure? This didn't work two other times.&#34; The lady - &#34;Yes please, you need to let me help you.&#34;<br /><br />CLICK.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the way with so many of these electronics/tech companies. You look and try to find a good solid product because if you get them on the phone or deal with their tech support in any way, you are hosed.<br /><br />I finally figured out the problem the next day and it was not even with the device. It was with the monitor on the receiver end that was flipping out from the signal coming from the transmitter. New monitor, BAM! It worked. Why it worked half way through the setup and died who knows.<br /><br />The device is in and running. No real issues to speak of. This run is only around 50 feet or so and the picture comes through quite good. No pc hooked to the receiver side, only using a pc on the transmitter and mouse, keyboard and monitor on the receiver.<br /><br />I called tech support to ask 1 question; &#34;I am only calling to make sure I have this thing setup right because I am experiencing weird problems.&#34; Over 1 hour total time and no answers. Total waste.",2015-08-31

They come in a wide variety of styles - plastic sticks, metal swivels (like this one), silver bullets, gold bars, iron man, and a whole range of generic and novelty styles drives advertising huge memory capacities at wildly low prices. What do they have in common? If you look inside, they have the same internals and they all have fake capacity.<br /><br />You may spend a day or several (at typical USB 2.0 speeds), but in teh end, you will find all but the first few GB unreadable or corrupt.<br /><br />Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.ey can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.",2015-08-31

Finally, I decided to pull the trigger and buy one.  I thought it would be &#34;like an enormous iPad&#34; (since it is a touchscreen) that can also go on a stand and be a TV (for streaming videos and the like) and could also be used for Skype lessons.  At the same time that I purchased this Lenovo Horizon 2 27: All in One, my husband purchased a beautiful 27&#34; iMac and made fun of me for wanting the Lenovo.  In addition to the fact that the Lenovo was a touchscreen, the Lenovo was also less than half the price of the iMac and could easily be carried around or rolled around on a cart.  So when both products showed up at the same time, the computers were set up and my kids immediately flocked to the much more fun Lenovo.  That's where the fun ends.  Almost immediately, the &#34;Power On&#34; button on the side of the Lenovo got stuck in the frame of the computer.  No matter what we did (with tweezers, etc.) we couldn't get the button to come out - so the computer was in the constant state of being powered on - in other words, not working at all.  At this point, my kids had used the computer a handful of times, and I had not used it at all - we had had it for a few weeks.  Apparently, the warranty doesn't cover this type of issue (which is considered damage by owner, not a faulty part).  The numerous times I've tried to call Lenovo for help, they couldn't find the Serial Number in their database at all, so I couldn't register the warranty online or by phone.  I had to take the computer into a service center during which I waited in a LONGGGGGGG line on a Saturday during which several customers ended up &#34;going postal&#34; on the numb employees working there - screaming about how long they waited and about how someone calls them and says it's ready and then it's not...  After a couple of hours of waiting, my number was called, and the person helping me said that the stuck &#34;ON&#34; button was not covered under warranty, but they would request that the problem be covered as an exception.  We had zero confidence that the exception would be granted.  We left the the Lenovo, original box and packaging and cord with a strong sense that we'll never see it again - it was like dropping it into a black hole (completely disorganized place).  The couple of tissue paper like forms that they left with us had no details (like that the computer had been left there with the original box and power cord), and I was forced to sign something that says &#34;I hereby acknowledge that the damage was due to my personal negligence...&#34;  It's been several weeks, and after waiting a LONGGGGG time on the phone line when calling the well-kept-secret phone number of the service center, I'm left on hold when someone finally picks up the line and/or I can't get anyone to pick up the line to see what the status is of the computer.  At this point, I'm willing to just pay for someone to pry out the ON button.  My husband keeps giving me this knowing I-told-you-so look.  Drives me crazy when he's right!",2015-08-31

(with some Phono Input Recording Issues)","There are already many reviews on this product.  So, I'll try not to repeat too much.  I purchased the SB1240 with a main purpose to convert my LP records collection by using the Phono Input.  Right away, the output sound quality is just absolutely beautiful.  I've been a long time audio enthusiast and have had the opportunity to hear many high end equipment.  So, I have a good reference of what really great sound should be.  For the price, this unit cannot be beat - IMO.<br /><br />For the Phono Input, I've encountered some serious issues that I'll give some hints that worked for me.  You can achieve amazing results - I'm listening to a converted album as I'm writing this review.  No, you will not be able to make your LPs sound like the CDs that we're now accustomed to hearing.  There will be some remnants of clicks, pops, and hiss that are all a part of the analog sound.  And, there is no quick way to get the conversion done.  Yeah, we also seem to have lost patience in the digital (downloads) age.<br /><br />The main issue that I encountered was that I was only able to record the LP for about 2 to 3 minutes and the SB1240 would just locked up and not output anymore sound to the Audacity program that I'm using for recording.  You can unplug the SB1240 and plug it back in to reset the unit.  But, it will just do the same thing over and over.  So, I updated all the software downloaded directly from Creative (http://support.creative.com/Products/ProductDetails.aspx?catID=1&subCatID=207&prodID=19829&prodName=Sound%20Blaster%20Digital%20Music%20Premium%20HD/X-Fi%20HD&subCatName=Others&CatName=Sound+Blaster&VARSET=prodfaq:PRODFAQ_19829,VARSET=CategoryID:1).  The problem persisted but now I have updated software :)  I did not want to give up yet because the sound quality was so compelling.  I found out that it was a configuration issue.  In Win 7, Start&#62;Control Panel&#62;Hardware and Sound&#62;Manage audio devices&#62;&#34;Playback&#34; and select &#34;USB Sound Blaster HD&#34;.  For some reason, the Phono Input recording does not like sound output to any other device and that is what caused the SB1240 to lock up on my system.<br /><br />Now, I'm recording away by using Audacity.  But, the Click Removal filter in Audacity is not effective enough to my liking.  I also tried several other paid programs to no avail.  They all seem to create too much sound coloration by the time the settings are strong enough to remove the clicks, pops and hiss.  Finally, I tried using the Creative MediaSource 5 Player which was installed in my system this entire time.  It has an Audio Clean-up feature that removes clicks, pops and hiss.  Surprisingly, this feature works really well!  I set &#34;Hiss&#34; setting to 30%, the &#34;Original Hiss&#34; to 50% and the &#34;Click&#34; to 50%.  The result is what I'm listening to right now - delightful!  Do not use the &#34;SVM&#34; Smart Volume feature.  It tends to introduce coloration and muddies up the sound.  Hats off and thank you to Creative for such an outstanding noise filter!<br /><br />I used &#34;Virtual Audio Streaming 4.0&#34; (http://www.virtualaudiostreaming.net/) to capture the sound output from the Creative MediaSource 5 Player so that I can convert the sound to other formats for my portable sound players.<br /><br />A minor problem that Creative Customer Support helped me to resolve was the Line Out did not seem to be working.  I found out that when the Headphone jack is being used, the Line Out will be muted.<br /><br />Lastly, do give the Creative Entertainment Console program a try.  The SBX&#62;Crystalizer feature does add some life back into old recordings.<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful.me reason, the Phono Input recording does not like sound output to any other device and that is what caused the SB1240 to lock up on my system.

Windows 7 recognized it from the word go. Sharp picture, no ghosting, no dead pixels. I have just two complaints, neither one the monitors fault. Games don't necessarily support 2560x1080 resolution and may crop on top and bottom. I downloaded Flawless Widescreen (http://www.flawlesswidescreen.org/) and was able to solve my display problem with Skyrim. You may or may not be able to find support for your game at the website since they have only a limited number of titles listed, otherwise going into the games conf.ini and tweaking it may be your only hope. The other beef I have is watching movies. Again not the monitors fault. I haven't been able to find a video player that lets me resize letterbox movies to fill my screen without stretching them. I'm not talking about the ones that fill the screen vertically with the black bars on the sides but the ones with the black bars on top and bottom as well as on the sides. With a regular non-ultra 24&#34; widescreen the picture is actually a bit larger because of the extra height in relation to width. You get the same amount of wasted space top and bottom but less on the sides. Still, this is nitpicking. I will be buying ultra wides from here on out.

A look at the reviewer accounts shows that four of them simultaneously wrote similar or identical reviews for several other (questionable) products, all from the same small group of sellers. The remaining review is a cut & paste of a recent SanDisk SD card review, with the word &#34;SanDisk&#34; clumsily removed wherever it appeared. See &#34;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3IFXVSB4B5Y&#34; for the cut&paste source.<br /><br />If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is.<br /><br />The other red flag is price, which is about 40% below the expected price or real memory. The flash drive and SD card memory market is highly competitive, and there just isn't that much room for a generic to come in at such a low price. If a price seems too good to be true, it often is.<br /><br />I advise extreme caution. Your valuable data is at risk.<br /><br />Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />Be especially wary of cards with a stated capacity of 64GB or above marked as &#34;SDHC&#34; (not &#34;SDXC&#34;). The SD card association controls and licenses the SD card standards and they define &#34;SDHC&#34; up to a maximum capacity of 32GB. For larger capacity cards, only the &#34;SDXC&#34; standard is valid.<br /><br />There are plenty of good 32GB SD cards are out there. Expect to pay roughly $15 and up for 32GB (as of Q3 2015) and significantly more for 64GB and 128GB cards.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.aximum capacity of 32GB.

You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.  Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.",2015-08-31

I have this Wi-Fi extender paired with a Netgear C6300 cable modem/router.  The cable modem is upstairs in a closet and the wifi extender is downstairs in a central location in our house.  So far the success rate of the Extender has been pretty good.  It has definitely extended the range of my C6300 I have; however I have noticed unreliable connections to the dual-band SSID on my network.  I probably am able to get it to connect about 90% of the time correctly.  The other times I fell back to my AT&T signal in the house on our iPhones.  Installation was straightforward and only took 5 minutes to get it going.  For a quick solution to extended your wifi range, you really can't go wrong with this setup.",2015-08-31

The battery life is great and I strongly recommend installing Samsung 64GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDXC card for more memory.  Need a screen protector for it?  Go with the Aomax® For SAMSUNG Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition P600 Tempered Glass Screen Protector.  Put some movies, music, tv shows, and pictures on it.  This is an amazing tablet for work and for play.",2015-08-31

Very are very stupid, and since then I have noticed that Logitech does some pretty stupid things.  Now that I got that off my chest, these new ones truly work well.  There is no problem connecting and they work very smoothly.  The ball color is a nice blue.  I had to clean it well when it arrived, it was stiff and coated with something.  But after wiping it with one of those microfiber cloths it nows works just fine.  I am happy that Logitech finally got this one working correctly, but they truly don't market this trackball properly.  They should make them in different colors and designs.  For me a trackball is truly the only type of pointing device anyone should use.  They are much better to use than a mouse.  I still don't understand why people don't know this.  They are always were you leave them and they can be even used as in gaming.",2015-08-31

From the start it felt weird to type on, and I was making a lot of typos mainly because the silicone just doesn't bend enough to fully register you're pressing a key. The light does still shine though the cover, but only just, and only noticeable when there's no other light in the room.

When I tried installing the included software, I was surprised to find one of those obnoxious &#34;bloatware&#34; monsters giving birth to numerous ad-filled utilities all over my PC! I couldn't wait to uninstall it (them)!  Imagine my annoyance when I found that these programs were of the &#34;self-protecting&#34; type, that hid themselves from my uninstaller.<br /><br />Horrible.  I had to dig them all out and then clean up the mess with CCleaner.<br /><br />Samsung deserves high marks for the hardware but they should be ashamed of themselves for including such terrible software to unsuspecting buyers, IMHO.",2015-08-31

The ability to select different font types and sizes is nice, and you can easily add bookmarks. My kindle just updated within the past few days and added the &#34;Bookerly&#34; font, which is Amazon's font specifically designed for kindle. It's nice, but I prefer Palatino out of the options available, so I stuck with what I already liked. The price is good, and it can hold a LOT of books. The screen is also easy to read, even outside in bright light.<br /><br />On the Negative Side: The touchscreen is really sensitive. If I bump the kindle, all of the sudden my font is huge, and then I have to make it smaller again. Or I'll find myself on another page. I appreciate the ease on turning pages, but constantly having to readjust my font every time my cat decides to bump the kindle, or if I put it facedown on my lap for a moment, is really frustrating. There also isn't a built in light on this model, so you need to get a booklight or make sure that you have adequate light to read with.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good kindle, but I miss my buttons...

I was able to figure out how to add other apps by downloading to a different kindle and then giving permission on this one. Not sure how that would work of we didn't have another kindle fire in the house though.

Thus I just let the battery finally run down and I turned it completely off and when it recharged I was unstuck. This also gets pretty hot on the back when I'm reading a Kindle book. Packaging of the device when it was shipped was ridiculous. A padded envelope ONLY with the normal carboard box holding the actual device just shaking around in there. I didn't consider that adequate for an electronic device. I had ordered Turkey Jerky at the same time and it came in the standard amazon box with air pillows inside.

It is cheaply made and does not feel great to the touch, but given the price, it is acceptable (but there are others that don't feel as bad). My biggest issue is that once the cover was put on my iPad mini, I couldn't plug anything in!!! The plastic cover surrounding the precious few inputs on the iPad (lightning connector and headphone) block many connectors from making enough contact with the device. The manufacturer designed the cover to create small openings just around the camera, speaker, power button, volume, speaker, and dock. These are very form fitting and looked nice at first, but really limit what you can do or plug in to the device. The camera connection kit did not plug in. My adapter for 30 pin to lightning did not fit. Even my headphone plug did not fit inside the space allocated in the case. Basically I would have to take the iPad out of the case in order to plug in headphones or anything other than a straight lightning cable. I am not sure who actually uses this or how it has 10,000+ reviews that are generally positive? I would avoid this.",2015-08-31

I have the transmitter setup in a room that already had a Direct TV Genie box running. I have the receiver setup one wall away and about 18 feet away.<br /><br />When it is working it has a great picture and the sound is good too.<br /><br />The issues:<br />Every now and then when you turn on the TV the IOGEAR transmission just starts to flip out. I have noticed it always does this on the IOGEAR channel 8 and 9. I have to turn off the unit to try and reset it. I wish there was a way to make it stay on one channel so I could avoid channel  8 and 9.<br /><br />When I fast forward and sometimes when I pause the Direct TV Genie the IOGEAR starts to look for a new channel and it blanks out the screen for 15-30 seconds while it is doing this and I really hope it does not end up on channel 8 or 9 because I have to turn it off to reset it then. This is very annoying when you are trying to fast forward through commercials, I would say it does this 2 out of 3 times.<br /><br />I have tried moving both the transmitter and receiver to different locations to try and mitigate these problems but to no avail, it is always the same no mater where I put either unit.",2015-08-31

Price is the second.","Other cards of this style (&#34;EVO&#34;, but not &#34;Samsung&#34;) have proven to be fake capacity, especially when offered at 50% below the market price for real memory. Check the reviews for other generic mid- to high-capacity SD cards that are similarly low-priced..You will see a pattern of cards that seem to work at first, but eventually suffer significant data loss.<br /><br />*** YOUR DATA IS AT RISK ***<br /><br />Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone, your camera and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />There are lots of good 64GB SD cards are out there. Expect to pay roughly $25 and up for 64GB (as of Q3 2015) and at least twice that for 128GB cards. Expect only a very slight price difference between brand name and generic drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase of this test usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient to weed out the fakes.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

Attempts to call several HP service numbers proved fruitless as the reps either could not access my case information or had non-functioning voice mail systems.<br /><br />So here’s my story...<br /><br />In November of 2014 I purchased an HP Chromebook 14. It had 4G of RAM and a 32G SDD. I was happy with it. While not as sleek as an Apple product, it met my needs.<br /><br />Around Feb or March of this year (2015) I noticed that some of the keys weren't working, specifically the I, J, U, T, and a few others. I installed all updates, and even power washed the unit, but no luck. I called HP, they agreed that the unit was defective and dispatched a box for return and repair.<br /><br />After about 2 weeks I received the unit back, but the keys STILL didn't work. Checking the paperwork it became clear that HP replaced the MOTHER board, not the KEY board.<br /><br />I called, complained and another box was dispatched. This repair took over three weeks due to some part shortage. I found this unacceptable, complained and my repair was expedited.<br /><br />I received my repaired unit in April, but noticed that Chrome would crash (He's Dead Jim) frequently. I put up with it fora while, but recently started to dig around. What I discovered is that I no longer have 4Gig of RAM, but 2 Gig and that my processes consume most of that.  When the motherboard was replaced it had the incorrect RAM size.<br /><br />After contacting HP yet again, and speaking to the above case manager, it was agreed that a new Chromebook was in order.  This was on July 28th.  Any and all attempts to determine when (or if) my new Chromebook will ship have been met with radio silence.  Emails are not answered and phone messages are not returned.  Collectively I’ve spent hours either on hold or  speaking to a rep.<br /><br />I’ve come to the conclusion that the replacement of my Chromebook was a lie, that HP felt that if they delayed the process long enough, I’d simply give up and go away.<br /><br />Purchase a product from this company if you feel you have no alternative, but do so knowing that in the event service is required (even under warranty) you’re basically on your own.<br /><br />You’ve been warned.",2015-08-31

I gave it a while to maybe break in and had to clean it frequently, but it got worse and worse over six months until it was unbearable to use.. I purchased another M570 figuring I had gotten a bad one. I was wrong the replacement was just as bad.<br /><br />I had read some great reviews of this mouse, so I figured I would give it a go.  The fit is pretty good. My hand feels comfortable on it. My hand is getting use to the different shape from the M570 pretty easily.  Installation could not have been easier, I plugged in the USB Receiver and in seconds the mouse was working. I am using Windows 7 64bit.  The ball moves effortlessly like my older Logitechs did.

This drive will destroy your data.","The style shown is a Kingston DTSE9 USB Flash Drive, but genuine DTSE9 drives are only made to a maximum capacity of 128GB.  See &#34;http://www.kingston.com/datasheets/DTSE9H_us.pdf&#34; for Kingston DTSE9 product specifications and check for yourself.  In fact, *nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. The top capacity on the market is the 1TB Kingston Predator.<br /><br />Any DTSE9 advertised with a higher capacity is a Chinese counterfeit. These counterfeits invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low.  You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.se drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves.

I have managed to get the tablet to work (at all) on a new Windows 10 Toshiba laptop - I also tried on an older Windows 7 Lenovo, my new Macbook Air, a Mac mini, and an older Macbook (whose OS was too old according to the installation software), and my Ubuntu 14.04 desktop at work (no go).  The CD could not be read by the Mac mini and necessitated a visit to the Genius Bar at my local Apple store to get it ejected (turns out you need a wired keyboard to be sure to eject a stuck CD).  I may have actually successfully installed the drivers on my new Macbook Air but didn't know it (see below).<br /><br />After numerous hard reboots and try try again I finally managed to complete the installation process on a new Windows 10 laptop - suddenly managed to get to the finish without the system hanging, and amazingly, saw that the tablet controls the cursor, but then what?  It turns out that you have to register the product to get a free copy of Corel Painter Essentials 5 in which yes the tablet works.<br /><br />My adult son is pretty psyched about using this tablet when he saw it - he is more familiar with Wacom then I was, and I expect he will get the most use out of the Windows 10 laptop anyway, so I feel pretty good about this - I think a motivated user with some artistic ability will probably get good use out of this.  Like I said, four stars is probably generous based on my experience, but there appears to be a large community of Wacom users and a lot of instructional videos available online - I think eventually this tablet will have that kind of community support and so I am giving it an extra star for potential.acom users and a lot of instructional videos available online - I think eventually this tablet will have that kind of community support and so I am giving it an extra star for potential.",2015-08-31

Instead of giving such a long introduction I'll just right down to it:<br /><br />Things I really like about this keyboard:<br />1) It's got mechanical keys that really make typing easier.  I replaced a different one that was more like a laptop keyboard.<br />2) It's fully wired with a long USB3.0 cord.  This basically makes sure there are no mistypes or battery issues.<br />3) The media buttons are simple and very useful.<br /><br />This I didn't like about the keyboard.<br />1) The biggest problem I had is it has a very rough sharp ridge on the front.  It got painful after a while, however, this was easily fixed by buying a separate wrist restpad. (-1 star)<br />2) It sometimes had a little bit of issues with sliding around my glass desk, not enough to remove a star as it wasn't horrible, but beware or prepare to get something to keep it from sliding.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />This keyboard is loud, like throwing legos down a flight of stairs loud.  Don't use this in a quiet environment.<br /><br />Aside from everything, I have no regrets for this keyboard and don't see myself having to buy a new one anytime soon.",2015-08-31

They are poorly made and poorly serviced.  HP’s customer service knows nothing of either the customer or service.<br /><br />I have been awaiting shipment of my replacement Chromebook for over a month (details below).  Due to the complexity of my issue I was assigned a Customer Relations Case Manager (Vivian Hernandez, PPS CSS-A Customer Relations Case Manager).  Her co-worker, Paola Vanessa Picon was also included in all correspondence.<br /><br />The last I heard from either of these two ladies was on Aug 11th.  I was told that my Chromebook would ship on Aug 28th.  That day has come and gone.  Despite several follow up emails and voice messages I have not heard back.  Attempts to call several HP service numbers proved fruitless as the reps either could not access my case information or had non-functioning voice mail systems.<br /><br />So here’s my story...<br /><br />In November of 2014 I purchased an HP Chromebook 14. It had 4G of RAM and a 32G SDD. I was happy with it. While not as sleek as an Apple product, it met my needs.<br /><br />Around Feb or March of this year (2015) I noticed that some of the keys weren't working, specifically the I, J, U, T, and a few others. I installed all updates, and even power washed the unit, but no luck. I called HP, they agreed that the unit was defective and dispatched a box for return and repair.<br /><br />After about 2 weeks I received the unit back, but the keys STILL didn't work. Checking the paperwork it became clear that HP replaced the MOTHER board, not the KEY board.<br /><br />I called, complained and another box was dispatched. This repair took over three weeks due to some part shortage. I found this unacceptable, complained and my repair was expedited.<br /><br />I received my repaired unit in April, but noticed that Chrome would crash (He's Dead Jim) frequently. I put up with it for a while, but recently started to dig around. What I discovered is that I no longer have 4Gig of RAM, but 2 Gig and that my processes consume most of that.  When the motherboard was replaced it had the incorrect RAM size.<br /><br />After contacting HP yet again, and speaking to the above case manager, it was agreed that a new Chromebook was in order.  This was on July 28th.  Any and all attempts to determine when (or if) my new Chromebook will ship have been met with radio silence.  Emails are not answered and phone messages are not returned.  Collectively I’ve spent hours either on hold or  speaking to a rep.<br /><br />I’ve come to the conclusion that the replacement of my Chromebook was a lie, that HP felt that if they delayed the process long enough, I’d simply give up and go away.<br /><br />Purchase a product from this company if you feel you have no alternative, but do so knowing that in the event service is required (even under warranty) you're basically on your own.<br /><br />You've been warned.",2015-08-31

I purchased this computer last year and have used it for a while, and at first I liked it a lot because it was the first computer I ever had. The main problem I have with the computer is the slimness factor. Although the slimness of the computer may be a selling point, I would take into consideration that this weakens the computer structurally and has other downsides.  I took it to school and &#34;dropped&#34; it from a very low heigh and the display didn't close correctly. I can bend the display with practically no force whatsoever. The typing on this keyboard is especially odd and will take some time to get used to. Because the computer is very slim, the keys have no place to go (downwards) so they are very shallow. I had a tendency to double press the keys because there was no tactile feedback that I had pressed the key. The last major problem that I had with the computer is the fans. The computer only has 2 fans inside, one for intake, and one for exhaust. When you use your computer and the components start to heat up, the fans kick on and try to dissipate the heat. Well because there are only 2 relatively small fans inside, they have to spin at higher RPMs to get rid of the heat, which results in lots of noise. Even with one Google Chrome browser tab open (and I know that Google Chrome uses lots of system memory), the fans sounded like they were going to explode any second. I have had lots of problems with the battery! Only a few weeks after I had the computer, I had to send it to Acer for them to replace the battery because mine was not functioning. It had something to do with static electricity getting into the system. This was very frustrating because randomly the computer would shut down, sometimes in the middle of writing papers for school.<br /><br />Pros and Cons list:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Slim Computer<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slim Computer<br />Loud fans (with only one tab open)<br />Nonfunctioning battery<br />Bad keyboard (had a tendency to double press the keys because they are very shallow)<br />Very unstable / not sturdy AT ALL (Could bend the screen with ease)<br />HIGH price point!<br /><br />In the end, I would not recommend this computer to anyone looking for a new one or an upgrade.",2015-08-31

I'm writing this review just to encourage you to use an internally mounted Hard Drive caddy for your install into such a laptop.<br /><br />First clone attempt, I mounted the SSD using an external USB-connected Pluggable SATA/USB dock. The Samsung Data Migration software acted very flaky, displaying many errors. I eventually managed to clone the hard disk, but Data Migration created unexpected partitions on the SSD, and the disk wasn't bootable. I also tried mounting the SSD using a Vantec SATA/IDE to USB adapter. This led to multiple, similar problems.<br /><br />Bottom line: once I had mounted the SSD into an UltraBay adapter (I chose an [[ASIN:B00NAMU8NO Nimitz 2nd HDD SSD Hard Drive Caddy for Lenovo Thinkpad T420 T430 T510 T520 T530 W510 W520 W530]]), everything went easily and smoothly.<br /><br />As an aside, Samsung's Secure Erase is unreliable and inadequate. SSE didn't recognize the Samsung SSD; it failed to create functional boot CDs (despite trying on two different machines, always returned &#34;invalid opcode&#34; and didn't boot) and the boot USB flash drive, also reported 'no valid SSDs'. I had to down-grade to an older version of Samsung Magician (v 4.4) just to create the boot media. But ultimately, Secure Erase wasn't needed.  Once the SSD was tucked into a Hard Drive Caddy, Samsung Data Migration did the job, overwriting the junk from the failed clone attempts and fully cloning the hard disk.",2015-08-31

The price was reasonable ($80) and I have used Logitech gaming products for quite a while now (G510S Keyboard and G502 Mouse) and have enjoyed them. The G930 Headset was terrific; wish I could say the same thing about the G430. First off the bat, the sound only emanates out of the left speaker, even though stereo and surround sound is activated (the 930's did this perfectly). Next, when I tried to set up the software from Logitech's support site, it was like no go. Nothing happened, except that the firmware was not affected. Also, the sound quality is not up to par. I use TeamSpeak to communicate with my gaming compadres when we play or raid. I can barely hear them talking, even though the sound control is turned all the way up.

I had no problem with it fitting my laptop. So, far it works as it should in that it charges to a full 100%. I'm going to check and see just how long the charge holds for and will update at the end of month #1. So, far no regrets.  It's been a few months - Okay, so I'm getting less than 2 hrs on a full charge. It's more like 1 hr 30...give or take a few mins extra.  You may get 2 hrs if you set the setting on your laptop just right, but I don't see anyone getting 3 hrs. UPDATE - It's been almost a year and I'm getting the dreaded, &#34;Low battery&#34; warning at startup telling to replace the battery. I feel like getting a year out of the  battery just isn't enough...dropping this down a star.   UPDATE 2 - 08/25/2016  I didn't think I'd get anywhere, but contacted seller and asked if the battery carried a warranty. I was told it did and was for one year. They sent me a new battery. I'll update once I've gotten some use out of it. So, for now the rating stays.  UPDATE 3 - 11/15/2016  A days ago, while starting my laptop, I got the dreaded &#34;Replace battery&#34; warning AGAIN. I've tried to calibrate the battery, but still the same issue. This battery lasted less than 3 months. The price of said battery seems to have gone a bit since I first bought it. While the battery seems fine with the A/C charger plugged in, still the point is be able to run the laptop with just battery power. I get 30 mins at best on &#34;Balance setting.&#34; I'd skip buying this battery for your laptop.

For a HDD I installed a simple 32GB M-SATA drive to boot OpenELEC off of. My primary storage is on a Synology Diskstation so hard drive capacity wasn't a factor for me. Boot time is super quick - from power on to the OpenELEC menu it's about 8-10 seconds after tweaking the BIOS and disabling stuff I didn't need.<br /><br />It does NOT come with a wireless adapter but it does have the antenna if you want to install one (don't knock off points for that, people - a wireless card costs peanuts!).

It does not maintain a speed that is reasonable in an environment where other devices perform just fine. I do not know how it has such high reviews.  The long version: I am majoring in Network Administration and Computer Information systems at college, so I have a few basic ideas of how to get a network up and running. I bought two of these cards for two separate computers. They work, but they are dirt slow and cannot maintain a consistent speed. I have a 50Mbps connection coming over a N900 Linkysys router that is only about 20 feet away through one wall. The fastest I can get this card to is 20Mbps at most. Usually it will drop down to 4Mbps.  I have updated the drivers, and rolled them back. I have moved my router closer. I have tried 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and dual-band. I have swapped cards out. I have adjusted antennas in every direction. I have tried no antennas. I have swapped antennas out. I even tried different PCI slots. I have tried more than any reasonable person would to get this product to perform as advertised.  This card advertised 450Mbps, but I only get 4Mbps of my 50Mbps connection. Meanwhile my generic network card,  with no antennas, in my 5 year old laptop pulls 60Mbps in the same location over the same connection. My USB dongle gets a faster connection speed, and I can at least maintain 15Mbps with it. For the record, I had two of these cards to work with so I tried both, and it is the same story with each. I also have a dozen other WiFi devices to prove without a doubt that it is not my router. This product does not perform as advertised. I do not know how it has such high reviews.  Another problem was this cards are the brackets. They were of low quality which made it hard to seat the card properly in the PCIe slot. All in all this card is garbage. Buy a USB adapter if you want a cheap network adapter. Your just wasting your money if you buy this thing. It can't pull full speeds through one wall at 20 feet, so it is worthless.  Update: Installed an ASUS PCE-AC56 card in place of the TP-Link adapter. The ASUS card was about $20 more, but I plugged it in and was pulling 60Mbps down instantly. I didn't even need to install drivers on Windows 10 to get the ASUS adapter to work.",2015-08-31

Its slim profile is so much nicer for a woman than my older bulky computer bag. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the color is darker than seen online.

I looked around the house for an old laptop cooling pad and attached it to the laptop but it did almost nothing to cool down my laptop. I decided to look online, I ignored all the cooling pads and found the Opolar Laptop Cooler and I was a little wary of trying a product that I had never seen or heard of before but after reading the reviews I decided to buy it and hoped for the best. At first I was concerned because of the odd shape and size of my laptop fan vent that it would not seal properly. My vent was a little too big but the Laptop Cooler formed right around it and worked quickly and easily. It output a lot of power for its small size but it was also very quiet. My other concern was that I was losing the portability of my laptop because it juts out from the side, but the first time I had to pack it up after assembling it was easy. The fan and seal stay together in one piece with the USB adapter. There is a metal strip that runs under the laptop joining the fan to a plastic holder under the laptop, this metal strip pops out easily and is slim and portable. My laptop had an AMD A8 APU which would heat up extremely easily. Ever since I equipped this fan my laptop has been between cold and moderately warm (when playing extremely graphic intensive games). I would strongly recommend this cooler for any laptop that needs a solution to over heating. I find the fan sticking out of my computer is more comfortable than a laptop cooler which raises the laptop. I would strongly recommend this fan to anyone who is looking for a new laptop fan.",2015-08-31

Otherwise, I really love it!  Update:  I've had my tablet now for 5 months and it is really starting to have some issues.  Although I've made it a point not to put much on it,  it has become very slow, apps don't want to open, when they do, it returns to lock screen on its own, touch intermittently becomes unresponsive, screen continues to go black for no reason, and it quit reading my memory card, also made by Samsung.  Really getting apprehensive about this tablet lasting any amount of time  Update:  have had this 6 months now and the issues are almost unbearable.

I had gotten used to onboard audio, as my old audio card died some time back and it was easier just to connect the motherboard audio rather than get a new card.  However, I kept my eye on the industry.  When I finally decided on this card, it was from an informed perspective.<br /><br />The features in this card are more than enough for casual to hard-core gamers, and for low- to mid-range audiophiles.  High-end audiophiles will want the next card up, which comes with a discrete secondary card for additional functions and features.  This card produces excellent sound quality for the price, with crisp highs and deep lows.  Positional audio is also relatively good through headphones, though nothing beats a true 5.1 or 7.1 setup for positioning in gaming.<br />The Controller knob is probably not necessary.  I've got a pair of Sennheiser cans with built-in volume control, so the knob is redundant unless I want to switch between headphones and speakers, but I don't use a speaker setup.  I've also read some reviews of how the volume unit diminishes the quality of the sound as well, as is likely to happen anytime you have to go through more connections, so unless you truly need it ... don't bother.  Just tap right into the back of the card, and leave the controller in the box.  It might make a useful part for mods and customizations.<br />I have no drawbacks to complain about ... this card exceeds my (admittedly not terribly high) expectations, delivers great sound quality, and has worked from the get go.  DO REMEMBER to disable your onboard audio prior to installation, otherwise your software might not natively choose the correct audio output.",2015-08-31

Prior to this model, I had two Dell P2411H screens my employer supplied for me. That's a decent monitor, but for any work that demands color or value accuracy you're out of luck. The viewing angles especially made things difficult as the distance from the top of the screen to the bottom was enough to cause a severe distortion in brightness giving everything a gradated look. Thankfully, I don't have those issues to deal with anymore.<br /><br />I think it owes to the VA2349S' IPS panel, but the color accuracy and viewing angles in particular have been rock solid. I'm picky so I went through and calibrated as best I could, and now I'm really enamored with the picture. The whites it produces seem very pure (not too warm or cool) and the blacks show very minimal bleeding. I have to switch to a fully black screen with the intent of noticing something for it to register as anything but pure black. Colors are all very nice but I have no real way of testing how accurate they are, however, I would say they're close the what my MacBook Pro's screen produces if a little less saturated.<br /><br />The screen has a matte finish which I much prefer to a glossy one. Glares and reflections aren't a possibility on this and I appreciate that. The bezel is a little thicker than other models out there and it is a bit glossy, but it hasn't distracted me and in a dual monitor setup I don't find the width a problem.<br /><br />Another reason I went with this particular model (after a rather thorough bit of research) was that it has a VESA mount. I had a monitor stand that I didn't want to make obsolete so that was important for me. The stand that comes with it seems a bit cheap, but I can't really speak to that.<br /><br />So far, after about a week or two of heavy use, I really can't come up with any major complaints which is saying something because I'm very particular. I was going to whine about having to come to grips with the ugly bird logo plastered on the frame, but Viewsonic was nice enough to make it a sticker that's easily peeled off. Really the only gripe I have is that I have to plunk down the cash for another one of these because having it next to my old monitor is making it look like junk.",2015-08-31

It is well constructed, and functions well. It lacks a separate power source, which may affect your charging time for phones, tablets etc. depending on your computer, but for additional ports for keyboards mice etc., it's fine. It has a single &#34;on&#34; light when plugged in to the vomputer, but not individual lights  for each device you plug in. It comes with a permanently attached cable with a standard USB plug to plug in to a port on the computer, and four (4) ports for plugging addition devices into the hub. The whole thing seems solidly built, the cable is firmly attached, and the ports feel snug and not loose for avery thing I plugged into it.<br /><br />Pros: Well built, does it's job, and is affordable.<br /><br />Cons: There is no external power supply, so that might be an issue for some uses, like charging phones etc.  But also means you don't have to find somewhere to plug in another popwer brick, There is only one power light, so no indicators for separate devices being plugged in. And finally, the permanently attached USB cable is short, and you can't replace it if damaged. You'll have to buy an extension cord if you need a longer one. On the other  hand, you can't misplace the cable either.<br /><br />A basic (as the name suggests) but good solid affordable product.",2015-08-31

About 2 months ago I moved to a new location so I powered the NAS down (yes pressed once then cycled to where it says press again ). I carried the NAS to my car where it was wrapped in a blanket and driven over (only about 3 miles).<br /><br />I carried it into my new house and set it on my desk where is sat for about until last week. Plugged it in to find the following message &#34;Data Degradation&#34;. What the heck does that mean? I went online and contacted support. They told me I can use the online support as it is live. Accessing the support was easy enough and I entered into a conversation.<br /><br />The tech person told me to power it back on and I did to find a new message that it was doing a data recovery on one of the drives. Great news! About 6 hours later that recovery was done and the NAS was fully operational. All my files were there and accessible. I then powered it down again and left it for a few days,<br /><br />I recently powered it back and I now have a new message, &#34;Cannot connect to discovery server&#34;. What does this mean? So I tried to access the online support and for whatever the reason I could not get it back. I followed the original link the first tech person gave me but no matter what I did the online support is no longer. Maybe you only get one shot at it.<br /><br />So now the last 10 years of my life are sitting in this little black box and I can not access it, I can't talk to the online tech people and I have no idea what the error message means because even after googling it I cannot find its explanation. Yes there are many people on forums who have asked about the same message but there is no clear answer.<br /><br />I would suggest staying away from this device as it seems to fragile and the tech support is spotty. I bought this with the idea that if a drive failed I would still have my data and could just replace my drive. Well that seemed to work once but now I have no idea what is going on and can only pray that I will get access to my data. It has to be there but where I do not know.<br /><br />Go else where.<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br /><br />Well, see, you never know about a company until things happen. Since I have written this review I received an email from a third level tech named Casey with a contact number. He said it was his job to help no matter how long it took to get my NAS back up and running. The new message was &#34;Could not find discovery server&#34;. He told what that simple meant was the NAS was trying to go online to find the server and could not access it.<br /><br />Well that was because at that time I had the NAS disconnected from the Internet. Who new! So I reconnected it to the Internet and sure enough that message disappeared. So the drive seemed to be fine and I asked him if he could wait a moment while I tried to access the drive from my computer. He was very polite and told me he had time.<br /><br />I could access it from the computer and so we started another round of troubleshooting with Casey helping using Team viewer. It turned out to simply be the NAS needed to be plugged directly into the Xfinity modem/wireless router and not the Xfinity smaller router they gave me for the security system.<br /><br />So now everything is working great all my data is alive and well and all I can say is kudos to Casey and Netgear. I understand that a company can't help forever but when you buy a device like this a little extra support, especially when the device starts burping up cryptic messages, is definitely needed and helpful.<br /><br />Maybe I was too harsh on the company so I am changing my stars to 5 for going the extra mile and looking forward to future purchases from Netgear. Thanks",2015-08-31

I prefer to run fans like this at full power, so I don't mind the wonky power dials. The fans are powered by a full sized USB cable, which is included. Bonus - there's a USB port on the back so I don't lose a port just because of these fans. They function quietly and give decent air flow. There's two feet that angle the fans and my laptop, but the angle feels far too extreme to be of use to me. I think the price is a touch too high for what it is.

In other words, a counterfeit (and fake-capacity) drive.","SanDisk does not make this drive. They do not even make this style. This is a generic USB flash drive stamped with the SanDisk name and packaged up in an equally counterfeit package. (You might also note that a virtually identical &#34;Samsung&#34; drive is listed by the same seller&#34;.)<br /><br />Also, counterfeit drives are invariably fake-capacity drives - low capacity drives hacked to make them appear to have a much higher capacity.<br /><br />In fact, *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will becorrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.is faked.

First off this is the first off it's kind that I've had the opportunity to sample and I was very impressed. Now with nothing to compare it to, I can just state what I noticed and saw for myself. This being a charging cable the most important factor is charging, and this works great. You can achieve a full charge in about 60% of the time needed with an OEM charger. The current wave of the future is fast chargers for everything; cell phones, tablets, electric cars etc...People are far to busy to wait around for something to charge haha. This is nice because you can in fact charge it in your wall outlet and you don't have to plug it into your computer so that is a nice function. The connection is great and secure, so no having to mess with the connection ports till its perfect then make sure you don't touch it. That is annoying and luckily you don't have to worry about that with this charger. The cord itself is a bit short but this isn't something you can use while it's charging anyways like a phone or tablet. So all in all I think this charger is great, nicely made and very affordable.",2015-08-31

The absolute best part about it for me was the setup process.  It was incredibly easy and self-explanatory.  The app walks you through the setup step-by-step and has a great UI.  The device itself lights up and lets you know what's happening during the process.  This was the first router I've ever set up, and it was an overall really positive experience.<br /><br />As far as performance goes, it feels on par or better than other routers we've used, even with five devices connected at once, which we tested out last night with our house guests.  Our mobile carrier offers wi-fi calling, and we've had difficulty with that in the past, but it's worked smoothly since switching to the OnHub.  Another great feature is that the app alerts you when it loses connectivity.  I got a message last week while at work, and when I got home, found that it had gotten unplugged at some point during the day (most likely by one of our toddlers).  I haven't had it long enough to be able to enjoy the automatic updates, but I'm looking forward to taking advantage of that feature.<br /><br />All in all, this router has done exactly what it needs to do, and is extremely easy to use, which is a huge plus.  I would recommend it to anyone that's in the market for a new router.",2015-08-31

It has always been ejected correctly before removal too. Only used a couple of times to move files between laptops too. It does not inspire confidence as is. Fortunately, I had backups on a HDD of those corrupted images. I expect more from Sony with their branding on these products. The down side with Sony branded goods is you usually pay more for them than comparably featured items. I have had better luck with off-brand drives. The keyword here is &quot;luck&quot;. Not what you want to be confined to when using a drive considered reliable. Maybe I should have considered the expense of this flash drive? It was pretty inexpensive given the capacity.

I had to disable the tap-to-click function on the track pad because I couldn't adjust to it, or it to me. That leaves &#34;press fairly hard in a corner&#34; as the only way to click, which is not great. Windows 10 installed a few days after I purchased it and seems to be the antidote to Windows 8, which was annoying for those few days I had it. It's light and it has a very decent battery. I took it to a coffee house and it worked well there.  The screen is a little narrow-angle for a laptop. The degree of it is that if you are looking at say, a cat picture from reddit, the detail will go away if you don't look straight at the screen and it might not appear as fluffy as it should. In the same conditions or worse, an iPad will still be clear. You will be able to read text if the designer provides decent contrast, though. On a desktop computer, or the sort of large laptop that you sort of really settle in with, this is not a problem because you'll establish a comfy position in your seat and optimize everything and leave it that way. On this type of computer you will tend not to optimize everything. When you're looking at a picture critically, you'll have to fuss with the orientation of the screen and maybe get out of that comfy slouchy position you're in.   A little off topic but after I got Win10 I tried the new Edge browser. You will find (late summer 2015) that lots of websites don't like Edge or can't figure out which browser it is. So I installed Chrome, which is an ironic outcome if you think about it.",2015-08-31

The clearance is pretty tight, and I'm using Silverstone's own sata cables and CP06 for power.

I am a bit disappointed in the build quality, as the sata connector for one of them broke when trying to fit it in.  (Ironically, the one at the end, which I didn't apply any pressure to while fitting in.)  It's useless, so for now I'll have to use the original CP05 that came with the case in its place.<br />Since these are all Silverstone products, I'd expect there to be better coordination on size tolerances.  Otherwise, it works as expected and does reduce cable clutter in the end.  Just be careful when putting them in.  Also, you'll have to re-crimp the CP06 sata power cabling.  just flip each connector to the other side of the cable and you should be fine.

Not even close! I've had the normal Boom for 2 years now and loved that thing to death. Sure it didn't have the BEST sound, but it was great for what it was and all of the other traits of the speaker made up for it. The design is elegant yet functional all at once and I didn't think there could be a better speaker out there...until the Megaboom arrived.<br /><br />I bought the Megaboom in Australia out the door for $230 (with their taxes included and with the generous AUD to US exchange rate at the time). The ONLY con compared to the Boom being that it's ever so slightly less portable due to its size, so no more sticking it in cupholders. Still, the Megaboom is completely submersible (tested), has a mega battery capacity, has twice the range (*100ft*), and sounds remarkably full and crisp. **A little tip is to place either Boom or Megaboom against a wall or in a corner up next to something solid for a generous boost in the mids and lows**<br /><br />Sure I loved my brand new Megaboom, or Hulk as he was aptly named, but it was a sad day for his little Boom brother, Thor. I just couldn't see myself using little Thor when I had all this speaker to play with. Nowadays I only bring out Thor if weight or size constraints are more pressing than having the absolute best sound, mostly with school or backpacking trips for example. It's nice to have both still, but if I had to only pick one however, it would most definitely be the Megaboom. There's no going back.",2015-08-31

Move along...","FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. This drive will destroy your data.<br /><br />Plastic sticks, metal swivels, silver bullets, gold bars, iron man, and a whole range of generic and novelty styles drives advertising huge memory capacities at wildly low prices. What do they have in common? If you look inside, they have the same internals and they all have fake capacity.<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.ctly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.",2015-08-31

I recommend upgrading the ram because its a easy simple upgrade.I also recommend putting in a ssd. I installed one and it turns on in and loads up in probably less then 5 seconds. however upgrading to a ssd will void the warranty. The original hard drive says VOID WARRANTY IF REMOVED, i still removed it taking my chances. and if anything does happen i will just pop my old back in because there really is no seal or anything to show you were tampering with it. And if there is oh well, because i dont see any problems with this laptop in the future year or years to come. Also i believe the graphics card is actually a gtx950 with a 4gb with video card not 2. i could be wrong, but when i checked it out on my computer it was a gtx950 with 4000mb of video. maybe a listing mistake but anyways that's what mine says.I do believe this could run current games, i dont game much but this does have the power, i think at least to run current stuff.

Another combination that I discovered playing a video game: right-arrow+space+d.<br /><br />Many keyboards have issues with ghosting when subjected to stress testing, but this one has a half-dozen combinations I need to consciously work around that I discovered through regular use.

These keys are getting popular due to being PBT+POM(no idea what that means) while also being clear to let light through from LEDs.<br /><br />The number row problem is fixed with the Ducky Mini keyboard  (the numbers light up), due to the LEDs being mounted on the bottom of the keyboard switches instead of on top making it shine through both number and symbol, that in mind I can see it being a nuissance with keyboards with a standard LED placement on the top of the switch like normal.

I saw this, and was a little bit weary due to the low price of the machine, but it sounded perfect. So, I got it and am not at all disappointed. It's small: About the size of a Wii in length and depth but a little wider. It's black, so blends in with other consoles and has pretty lights, that you can configure to whatever color you want it to be.<br /><br />Or you can put it on your desk, and use it as a low cost gaming computer by hooking a USB mouse and keyboard into it, because it does have a windows and console mode.  Windows mode takes you to your desktop, where you can browse or use other windows  programs like chrome, or skype, or play non-steam games..or use facebook and play facebook games if you are into that.<br /><br />The system is very powerful for the cost. I haven't played a game yet that didn't run on it./..i'm sure there are some, I just haven't found one. I have played Witcher 3, Grand Theft Auto 5, Watch Dogs, Alien: Isolation, wolfenstein: The Old Blood, The vanishing of Ethan Carter, H1Z1 and SubNautica just to name a few. All those title ran with no problem and played smoothly. For the cost? It's a bargain!<br /><br />I had heard complaints that the system runs loudly, but I haven't noticed it at all. The fan in my console is whisper quiet, and in fact I had to put my ear to the console just to make sure the fans were actually working. This console/PC hybrid worked out much better than I expected.<br /><br />EDIT: When I purchased this, it was 600 new, not the insane 1k people are trying to milk out of this.

The colors, patterns, key reactions and brightness are all fully customizeable for all keys, groups of keys or even the individual key itself.  It color cycles.  It pulses.  It does 'the wave'.  You can program it to do just about anything.  Now, making a cool color combination can be a little tedious, but if you're determined and creative you can make your keyboard flash like a disco.  Sometimes it doesn’t load the right profile, or it forgets what profile was loaded and defaults to something you didn’t want.  In fact, as I type this, Razer Synapse has stopped working, and that’s the interface that lets you control the pretty colors.  But when it does work, the colors are really amazing.<br /><br />But unfortunately, you may have to use this keyboard for typing and/or gaming, and that's where it falls short.  The keys are no more or less comfortable than other keyboards.  The clicks are a little loud but not noisome (if you think you’ll be bothered by the clicking noise I encourage you to find one in a store somewhere and hear for yourself).  It does function as advertised.<br /><br />Sometimes a key will get stuck.  If you're lucky, only thissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss will happen.  But sometimes the BACKSPACE key gets stuck, and you get to watch just how quickly the cursor deletes every word you just wrote.  And sometimes it's an arrow key, and instead of turning your video game spaceship to aim at the enemy spaceships, you just start spinning uncontrollably.  This to me is a fatal flaw.  This should not occur on a keyboard I bought just a few months ago.  I don't abuse this keyboard, I don't press the keys very hard and all my previous keyboards worked fine for years and years.<br /><br />Another irritating feature is that while the letters and numbers are backlit, the shift characters are NOT.  So at night you can look down and see 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, but you have to kind of think about which one is !, @, #, $ or %.  Same with : &#34; &#60; &#62; ? { } | _ and +.  This may seem minor and I kind of knew it when I purchased it, but I had no idea how much that would annoy me.<br /><br />There is an indicator to see if caps lock, num lock and scroll lock are on, but they're so dim you'll never notice them.  You can see them if you look at the keyboard from directly above, but if you sit and type like a normal person they will be invisible to you.<br /><br />Also, the keys are not backlit when your computer is booting up, so don’t use a complicated password on your PC or you’ll need a flashlight to enter it.<br /><br />They were kind enough to throw in a USB port and some mic/headphone hookups, but there are no dedicated media buttons.  I really miss having those buttons on my keyboard.

Tried to install and the Lima was not detected on the main local network. After switching to a different network entirely, the device was detected and made a system update.  Support site is a circular process of moving between two pages that repeat the same information (turn it off and on again, check if you have internet). Rinse and repeat. I did get real human support at one point, but they only repeated the information already shown on the website.  There's no status light on the device so it's hard to tell if it's alive and working properly which is a very poor design decision. You'd think that a light that came on to show power or readiness would be straightforward to include on a device costing $150.  After running for 20 minutes the Lima is quite warm, perhaps even a little hot. I don't know how well it will last with continuous use as a passively cooled device, though after leaving on for a day it did not get any hotter.  Of note is that during the installation process, you are given the chance to add mobile devices, but if you skip this, there is no obvious way to add them later from within the Lima software. You need to go to their website to find the address in order to download the app onto your phone, plus you need to install some third party crash reporting application in order to use the beta app. Also pay attention to the default settings on the phone app - on Android they default to using Wifi + Data to synchronize everything, so if you are on a limited data plan and don't check the settings fully, you could find yourself going over your monthly limit.  If you don't have administrator access to your router, there are two possibilities:  1. Your Lima won't be connected - see the problem I encountered above.  2. You won't be able to set up any port forwarding for the Lima. This means your data will pass through their servers encrypted; as there is no security audit yet on what they do, I guessyou have to take their word for what's going on for encryption. I also don't know what this would mean long term if they decided to turn their servers off or they change business models - maybe you'd need a subscription to keep going when they realize that they need to keep selling devices to keep the servers on. The whole thing is not so clearly explained, and it feels less like you own the device, rather that you have it on loan while they exist.  On the local network transfer speeds look decent, though not fantastic; the real test will be from a remote location.  ***Update*** Depending on what your remote location is, you may not have access to the Lima. I tried in a corporate managed network environment and could not access my Lima; enable tethering on my phone and connect to the tethered network and the Lima pops up. Depending on how you plan to use your Lima, you may not be able to connect to it from all locations - keep this in mind before you buy it as you may not be able to access from a remote location.  For $150 it's not worth it - keep in mind you need to bring your own storage to the table in order to use the Lima, and once the drive is in use on the Lima, you can't unplug it and move the storage to another location and access the same files.  If they continue to add features and capabilities in the future, then it could reach the promised potential, but at the moment you are buying a promise of future functionality rather than a fully realized product that's ready to go.",2015-08-31

I have to say that I am pretty happy with it. It types the same way noise-wise, feels the same as best as I can tell, has decent range, and it's a really beautiful color as well. I only had some minor issues with it, such as sometimes it would seem to stop working for a few seconds, and that it can be hard to tell with the indicator light if it is powered well enough. However I have not had these problems lately, I'm not sure if that was from playing around with the batteries or if it was the keyboard itself.

However, after unboxing, configuring, and installing some apps on this device, I really don't think I'll be using it much.  I have a year and a half old iPad mini with Retina Display, and I've already noticed several things about this device that annoy me in comparison to the iPad.  First, the display quality on this is terrible.  Aside from the low resolution, it looks like everything is grainy and over-sharpened - even the default wallpaper. Contrast on edges look artificially high.  It gets really hot while charging, using the provided wall wart.  It arrived 97% charged, but even just charging that last 3%, it was slightly uncomfortable to hold and use while charging.  The way the keyboard scales to the screen dimensions make it clunky and difficult to use.  If you plan do do a lot of typing with this device, definitely get a Bluetooth keyboard.  It also doesn't identify itself to Google properly.  I got an email from Google saying that I signed into my account with a Sony Ericsson Xperia X10.  And it was set to a Chinese time zone when I received it.  Other than that, it's slower to boot than the iPad, makes settings hard to find (I had to dig for a while to figure out how to check for updates), and the whole concept of not all apps being displayed on the homescreen / having to tap something special to view what's installed is really weird coming from iOS.  It didn't detect the settings properly for my Exchange account.  So yeah, a lot of disappointments so far, but what it has going for it is that it works, it runs Android, and it's inexpensive.  But it in no way even comes close to competing with even the least expensive previous model of Apple equipment.",2015-08-31

Scented beads are alright, they don't particularly smell very good nor do they smell much at all most of the time. The fan is waaaaaay too weak for Texas heat so if you want a summer fan where temps are near 100 this fan isn't worth the money even in an enclosed central ac'd building. I guess maybe I should try the ice thing and hopefully it'll make it better but for the most part I wouldn't recommened this item.

I love the fit over the keys and within the groove of the keyboard as a whole.  The &#34;caps lock&#34; transparent hole actually aligns with the light, so now I can see when the caps lock is on (the previous one was misaligned and I couldn't see the light unless the room was dark).  I love the raised key markers, like on the &#34;f&#34; and &#34;j' and right arrow buttons.  The color is such a nice muted gold.  It doesn't make the keys &#34;stick&#34; down when you type.  I don't mind the logo on the space bar at all.  Feels very durable and of good quality.  Since I anticipate having this for a while, I can't complain at the price.  I would definitely recommend this to anybody with a MacBook Pro, and I would most definitely repurchase this again! Just a note--the promotion at the time I purchased this was $1.00 off when you bought 1 or more.  I didn't receive that discount, even though it said it would be applied at checkout, so I don't know how that was supposed to work. Update--the gold color is fading quite noticeably on the left-hand's side of the keyboard.  It's turning this grey-blue color.  It hasn't been through excessive wear but the base cover is still very nice and functional.  Color is just fading.",2015-08-31

So I looked and considered several different mice, including this one. Honestly I really wanted the Apple Magic Mouse, but did not want to pay that much since I wasn't going to use it very often.  That's when I came across this one, which I saw had decent reviews, Bluetooth, and most importantly was decently priced thanks to Amazon's Warehouse Deals.  When I got the mouse I was a little surprised at just how short it is, it very thin compared to say a standard mouse you'd see bundled with a desktop, but not small like a travel mouse (not sure how to really express that in a different way).  One feature that is mentioned with this mouse is the blue-track laser.  Now I can't give you specifics compared to a standard red laser, but I've used this mouse on all kinds of surfaces without a mouse pad over the past few weeks, and have not experienced any problems.  The reasons for me this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that it feels a bit more &#34;plastic&#34; than I'd prefer and the mouse buttons are a little sensitive for my taste.  The mouse has a nice rubberized feel, and is very light, but just feels like thin plastic when you hold it, almost like it flexes a little in spots,  For the buttons (left and right, not the mousewheel which can act as a button as well), since it is so thin, there is not much travel on the button so it is more sensitive than I would like, just personal preference.<br /><br />So all in all I like this mouse and would definitely recommend it with those caveats that if you're not expecting something super sturdy, and don't mind sensitive buttons then go for it!",2015-08-31

The picture is clear, the colors are bright, the resolution upgrade from 1080p to 1440p is much more dramatic than I had expected, there are zero dead pixels and the stand allows for a wide range of positions. It has 1 HDMI, 1 DP, 1 DVI and 1 DSub (which, if you are buying a 1440p monitor, is useless unless you are using all the other ports for something else). The sound from the speakers isn't particularly good, but I use the headphone socket in the monitor to allow all my devices to output the sound to my headphones without having to change where I plug my headphones into. I don't get surround sound that way, but I use my regular TV setup for that purpose.<br /><br />My only slight complaints are: 1) the inputs are somewhat difficult to access so if you are planning to swap HDMI cables a lot (such as between a playstation, blu-ray and a laptop), this may get annoying (I don't so it's not a big problem for me), and 2) the on-screen menu is not the easiest to navigate since having the buttons behind sometimes makes it hard to align which button you are pressing with the screen prompts. Several times I have pressed the wrong button and had to exit the menu and try again. However, the superb quality of this product far outweighs these minor complaints so I am still giving this monitor a 5/5 rating.<br /><br />The price is fantastic for the quality - probably the best value for money in this category.",2015-08-31

It is the smallest size, but because I take it with me when I go on trips, it is perfect for my needs. The command keys always work perfectly and it recognizes my pen pressure very well. My only complaint is that if you're like me and take it with you, be careful of how you fold up the wires. The wires can become loose and refuse to work anymore (only an issue if you don't have it in one designated area all the time, so those of you who would have it at a desk or only move it once in a while should not experience this issue). This is my 3rd Intuos 3 since I started using them because of this issue. Luckily I'm very fortunate to never have had any problems with the pen, so I'm able to find sellers like this one who sell them inexpensively for the tablet and software only. For anyone who may be wary of the low cost and think there must me something wrong with them, I can assure there is not. I received mine today and have been drawing with it almost constantly since then. It works perfectly and because I already had the software installed, it remembered my keystrokes. I highly recommend this tablet to anyone who may be looking their first tablet as it is extremely easy to learn the maneuvers and customize to fit your art needs.",2015-08-31

I can still use the port just above the card with an esata card. I didn't need to use the cables that came with the card as those already in my machine worked perfectly (My card already has 2 power cables) Computer boots no problem, boot screen on all mini-DP ports (not tested on other ports). I tested this card with 2k arriraw footage (via arriraw converter), 2k DPX 10bit Log C footage (from arriraw converter) in After effects (project at 24fps, 32bit/channel float). So far stable and excellent boost in preview and render on AE timeline compared to original card. Also fast conversion with MPG Streamclip from 2K animation to 2k Prores. Running 2 displays (27 Apple cinema display and Acer 272HUL) via miniDP connectors, I get 2560x1440 on both monitors simultaneously (check pictures) The seller was great card arrived in just few days. I'll update this in case something changes. Enjoy your renders :)",2015-08-31

A few months ago I got a single medium one and I love it so much that I was thrilled to get a few more. Here’s what I love about them:<br /><br />• Sizes: This size assortment is perfect. I can fit a wide variety of items in them. I like taking my other one on car trips for things to keep the kids busy, so this assortment gives me some options.<br />• Versatile: The inner removable, soft dividers make these bags work for so many things. I have used my bag for my nail stuff, electronics and car rides. Each time I can move the dividers to where it makes sense. There are tons of things you can do with them, even though they are marketed as electronics organizers.<br />• Quality: These are made well. The zippers are smooth and never catch, the seams are all nice. I haven’t found any flaws at all. There’s plenty of protection. The medium one fits our 7” tablet perfectly and has plenty of padding to keep it safe from bumps and drops.<br /><br />I love these bags and am finding tons of ways to use them. The sizes are great and the versatility is handy for our family of four. I highly recommend if you’re in the market for this type of organizer. I was sent this to test and review. That has no bearing on my rating or review of the product, this is my honest opinion.",2015-08-31

There are grooves that snap in holding it in place and they do their job very well. This case doesn't obstruct any plugs or jacks and doesn't need to be altered to listen to headphones or be charged. I don't know why I never got a case sooner, because I've always been concerned with getting scratches or marks on my laptop, but now I know I don't need to worry about that since this case is durable enough to protect against light bumps and scratches. I also don't have to be as concerned about spills.

His friends were getting a certain type of case, and he wanted that case/keyboard.  I was given this New Trent case/keyboard to review.  He didn't want some cheap keyboard because all his friends were getting another brand.  But I forced him to try it.  Now he really likes it.  It allows the screen to be in many more positions, and at many more angles.  The keyboard has a slightly better feel, and the case is more durable than he was expecting.  Plus this case allows the iPad to swivel and the other one didn't.  He had actually borrowed the other case/keyboard from a friend for a few days, so he was able to do a direct comparison.  Plus one really nice feature for him was, it takes two keys to shut the screen off.  The other on takes only one.  Other kids would walk by and, just for fun, turn off the screens of their friends.  But they were unsuccessful with this keyboard.  So, he was quite pleased with that feature.",2015-08-31

Today it stopped working after a few minutes of working with it. I had tried multiple things to get it to work, such as unplugging it and then putting it back in, as well as restarting my computer but it just wouldn't work, I'm hoping this is just today, I have too much to do with it for it to stop now.

Device is very light, even with the official Kindle leather case on it. One thing I can't stand, and I wish manufacturers would stop doing, is the material. It is a fingerprint magnet. While I am glad it is not a glossy finish, the flat matte finish is not too much better.<br /><br />It is not as bad since I have it in the case, but for us OCD people, it is a little annoying getting all dirty like that.

The shipping took 3 weeks, but that's for the seller's review. As far as this case goes, I am so tickled with it! Given the low price I was a little skeptical when I ordered it, thinking it would be some cheapo plastic-like material and the color would be weird, but those worries were all for nothing!   The case is beautiful and has a nice leather-type feel to it. The color is a gorgeous purple, not as bright-neon as the photo looks, which I'm glad for :). All the access points line up perfectly, and the velcro holds great. Also, the back of the case where the velcro sticks has not picked at all, and I've put it through the ringer these past 10 days (with a little help from my kitten)! Time will really tell, but I don't foresee any problems. It holds great on its side when I'm watching Netflix at night, and it holds great in the vertical position when I'm reading recipes as I cook. Well worth the wait!  Update-9/7/15: Another great quality of this case, it cleans up really easily! I've been teaching myself to make bread lately...what a mess! And, of course, I have to look at each recipe on my Kindle 10,000 times as I'm making it lol. This case has had butter, flour, wet dough, and some other things (that I'm now sure don't belong in bread) all over it, inside and out and it just wipes right off. The felt-like interior doesn't seem to absorb any of the goo I've thrown at it...I'm pleasantly surprised!",2015-08-31

Has 3 case fans and has room for additional case fans to be installed in it.  Plenty of room for a long video card as well.  Comes with HDD slide-out trays for easy installation.<br /><br />My only complaint about the case is the space between the non-window side.  If it was about 0.5-1.0 inches in between where the mobo rests and the side panel, it would fit, but with tucking away cables, it bulges the panel out.

It was exactly what I was looking for. It has a very clever rotating feature that allows for easy portrait and landscape viewing. It is supported by ridges on the cover in 2 different positions. One I find good for portrait and the other for landscape. On a flat surface they work just fine.<br />The cover folds back for easy hand held reading. It has an elastic band to keep it safely closed. Be aware that this is not a cover that turns your device off when you close it. The case is made of a comfortably soft front (kind of like velvet) and a more solid back. All openings are unobstructed.<br />I wanted to simply protect the screen of my Kindle and keep it safe during traveling without spending very much money, particularly because the devices usually outlast the cover. I cannot complain about the price of this cover.<br />I got exactly what I wanted. The price was more than fair. The only downside, and I am not taking a star off for it, is that it is a little “floppy” and I expect that the binding where it gets folded backward might be the first to go. But, in fact, I have just bought another one in pink as a spare. Pink makes it harder to lose and easier to find. The first one was black.<br />This cover feels so nice to hold and I would recommend this product.",2015-08-31

I always thought it would be tricky to setup, but actually this is one of the simplest devices.  This is no more complicated than using a mouse.  I plugged it in, installed the software, and I was able to move the cursor around Adobe Photoshop CS6 without any further setup.  I didn't have to go into Photoshop menus, I was able to start drawing right away.<br /><br />A simple pen tap on the digital canvas makes the brush tool start laying down its mark.  The brush line gets thicker the harder I press down on the pen.  At first I was playing around drawing some text, like my signature.  What surprised me is how easy it is to use and how natural it feels.  It's like writing on paper with a felt pen.  Intuos Art responds accurately to slight differences in pressure to vary the thickness of the brush.  So my signature looked just like it does on paper, on my first try!<br /><br />If you are using a dual screen monitor, there is a setting in the Wacom Tablet Properties to assign one or both of the screens to the tablet surface (this confused me initially why Photoshop was only on the right side of the tablet, until I discovered this simple setting).<br /><br />Since this digital canvas moves the cursor around, it's also a quick way to navigate the Photoshop menus.  No need for a mouse.<br /><br />I love this digital canvas - it's nice and small (doesn't create desk clutter), sleek looking, and the pressure sensing is very accurate.<br /><br />(Important note - the very first Vine reviews were written before the product launched when the drivers were not available yet.  Some people, including me, initially gave this a less than favorable review because drivers were not available yet, so the computer would not recognize the digital canvas.  As soon as the product was publicly released on the market, we were able to download the software driver and actually use the Intuos Art canvas.  You may come across some early reviews that talk about the product not working, but that's only because of a glitch with the timing of the previews samples and software driver release.  Don't worry about reviews before the first week of September 2015, it works fine now.)t working, but that's only because of a glitch with the timing of the previews samples and software driver release.

Unfortunately, that means that the only places that wi-fi works reliably are that room and the room directly above it. The other rooms are behind mirrors which essentially reflect wi-fi signals.<br /><br />When I bought this, it allowed me to put one of the units in the room with the router, plug it into the wall, and plug an ethernet cable from the router to the device. I could put the other device anywhere else in the house and almost instantly have fast, wi-fi. It's a bit spottier than normal wifi so it can go out for a second or so every once in a while, but other than that it's excellent. The internet connection has low latency and high bandwidth.<br /><br />One thing is that the range of the connection from this device isn't particularly huge if you want the low latency and high speed. If it's in the same room or the adjacent rooms, it offers excellent performance. It goes down significantly if you get much further than that.<br /><br />Installation is dead simple. There is a little card that comes with it. It has a quick version of the instructions that allow you to have it up and running in a matter of a couple minutes. I definitely recommend the product.",2015-08-31

My real complaints are with the keyboard, and housing. I've never had a laptop that came in a plastic housing; it's like playing with a Fisher Price toy. The keyboard is very soft, and the track pad is challenging. It's really hard to believe that this laptop will last for any length of time.

The fact that it is flat when not in use is awesome and nice to carry around. It feels like it has some stealth features when slipping flat and nice in the laptop bag. Functionally, it's been great till now. The buttons and scroll surface work really well. When folding it, it locks nice and clean in the slot. What I don't know is how much fold/unfold can this take?

Every cheap cable I've ever had, I've had major issues getting it to charge my phone. Usually the issue is that the wires inside the cables are not thick enough to carry electricity to the phone properly and the phone takes forever to charge, if it ever does at all. So now, even though I still consider myself a frugal person who tries to save money wherever possible, I now spend the little extra when I buy microUSB cables for our phones. I have found that they work so much better and more reliably, and also last much longer. This cable is no exception, in face it offers a level of quality that I have not yet seen in a charging cable.<br /><br />The overall look of the cable is very appealing. The entire cable is red, with the ends being made mostly of metal and the cable itself being completely covered in braiding. The braiding makes the cable less likely to become tangled. There is a nice secure connection to the phone when it is plugged in and it seems to charge my phone a bit faster than even some of the other decent cables I have. Overall, I just really like the level of quality that went into creating this cable. I will be ordering more of these to replace my other aging charging cables.<br /><br />I received this cable at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

So far after about 3 - 4 weeks of use the laptop has held up great. There have been very few issues with the WiFi as some people had been claiming (possibly caused by earlier iterations of the laptop itself / Network Adapter), the hard drive runs at a decent speed (however, I could imagine slower speeds for more intensive programs), and the build quality is very good. I would recommend installing or purchasing the laptop with an SSD if you're planning on using some intensive programs.<br /><br />As soon as I purchased the laptop I simply removed all the bloatware from the computer and upgraded to Windows 10. There have been a couple instances of updating Windows leading to the system never wanting to completely restart, but aside from these couple of times it has performed well. As for the heat, I haven't checked the CPU / GPU temperatures under load, but the laptop itself never reaches a heat that I would find uncomfortable to the touch.<br /><br />Overall, the laptop is a good deal for your money (I purchased the laptop for $900.00 during the back-to-school time frame, so I plan on adding an SSD soon with the saved money) that will perform well while *hopefully maintaining its reliability. Some small quirks - not sure if related to Windows 10 or not - provoked me to rate it 4-stars, but others may not have these issues. I will EDIT if I ever run into any additional problems.",2015-08-31

I LOVE this device. If you're on a Windows or Mac laptop, probably like me, you already know that it is a major PITA to configure your new computer. Program disks, going to websites to find new drivers, driver updates, finding installation keys, calling Adobe or Microsoft to convince them that you want to install some software yet again. Sigh.<br /><br />With ChromeOS, almost no configuration necessary. Especially if you're already a heavy Chrome user and have Chrome set up &#34;just right&#34; on your Mac/PC. That configuration, as well as the extensions, auto-magically come over when you start up your Chromebook and sign in. And if, like me, you spend 95% of your time in Chrome anyhow, then you simply won't miss Windows or OS X.<br /><br />As for the hardware, seriously, this thing looks like a mini-MacBook. Then I show my Mac-loving brethren the touch screen, as well as the tablet mode, and first thing they want to know is &#34;how much&#34; and &#34;where did you buy it&#34;. This Chromebook will make your MacBook Air feel like a boat anchor, and the touchscreen/tablet mode will make others green with envy. Plus, this thing is seriously light, has a bright IPS display, will slip into a case made for large tablets, and runs for hours. If you're already bought into the Google/Chrome ecosystem, you'll love this device.<br /><br />Buy the 4 GB RAM version, since 2 GB is a little light if you like having lots of tabs open.

Usable? NO.","Let's start off with the one plus. Yes this keyboard can be washed. I've washed it in a dishwasher and I've submerged it completely in a sanitizing solution and it worked afterwards. That's the only positive thing I have to say about these keyboards though.<br /><br />This product is the Supreme poster child for terrible design. I think the people who designed this never once sat down and actually used their product.<br /><br />Where to start... the Home button is right next to the backspace button, so if you're used to a regular US keyboard layout then you're going to spend a lot of frustrating time getting used to the new layout, as the cursor moves where you don't want it to be and you erase perfectly good text. As if that weren't enough, they located the right trackpad button right where the heel of your right hand is when you use a natural hand position for typing. So if you use the \\""built in hand rest feature\\"", your right hand will push the button and your cursor will move to wherever you have it pointed to, which is almost invariably not where you want to be typing. The trackpad itself is too small for any real use and you'll find yourself begging the heavens for a mouse.<br /><br />And then there's the sticking keys. Out of the four keyboards that we tested, two of them have keys that stick down. One has a problem with the F1 button and another has a problem with the 4 key. Not only is it badly designed, it's also very badly made and I don't expect they would last very long under normal use. Not that I could bring myself to use one long enough to find out; its ability to resist the sudden deceleration of hitting a wall, or its ability to wistand the weight of a Freightliner truck, would get tested long before I ever washed it enough times to find out if it can withstand repeated washings.<br /><br />popped back up. See what i mean? Just for the record this sentence ws typed usimng the keyboard in question. The key spacing is all rong, and the comma key juststuck in the down position,, and now it [<br /><br />Maybe... MAYBE... if you work in the medical industry and type by pecking at the keys with two fingers... this might be worth your time and money...

The one thing it really impressed me with is the range.  With my previous keyboard sometimes I get dropouts or slow responses from the couch but this thing works perfectly.  The light is also very nice and works well.  My only gripe is you have to first press a key to turn it on so you have to choose some safe key to press.  I wish it worked like the Harmony One remote where when it detects movement it turns the lights on.  I'm happy with every aspect of it except one thing.  The battery doesn't last very long at all.  It lasts me about 3 weeks on one charge which is kind of crazy low.  I've had it for two months now and had to charge it three times after the initial charge.  My old keyboard with two AA batteries lasted 6 months and within a minute I could have it up and running with new batteries.  With this keyboard you have to plug it in to let it charge so it can be difficult or impossible to charge and use at the same time.  I even resorted to using one of those small battery banks so I can have the keyboard with me while it charged.  The only other con is it absorbs oil and fingerprints like a monster so if that sort of thing bothers you this may not be ideal.  The keyboard and keys have a matte finish that really shows off oil.  That doesn't bother me though but that battery thing does so four stars it is.",2015-08-31

Worth It.","Concatenated version:<br />It's awesome, records 1080p over HDMI at flawless framerates as well as high bitrate, manages source resolution changes in the middle of recording surprisingly well, good audio that's properly synchronized, and doesn't need any excessive cables to operate (low-profile). This is a very good product that is perfect for people who want to record gameplay or any HDMI device that doesn't have HDCP encryption (until Elgato decides to include an HDMI splitter in the recording device or the user has their own). It earns 5-stars as a recording/livestreaming device, not video editing software.<br /><br />A lot more details:<br />The image quality is like the source (check included pic) and he recording bitrate is quite high relative to YouTube's recommendations. YouTube's recommended bitrates for 60 FPS are on the left and my recording results are on the right, also at 60 FPS.<br />360p: YT~1.5 Mbps | HD60~N/A<br />480p: YT~4 Mbps | HD60~11 Mbps<br />720p: YT~7.5 Mbps | HD60~20 Mbps<br />1080p: YT~12 Mbps | HD60~40 Mbps<br />1440p: YT~24 Mbps | HD60~N/A<br />2160p: YT~53-68 Mbps | HD60~N/A<br />You may need some more hard disk space if you decide to record in a higher bitrates/resolutions. Cool thing is that the bitrate is high enough that it would be worthwhile to upsample the video to a higher resolution if you're using YouTube to allow the video player to output the higher bitrate to improve video quality.<br />It should be mentioned that you can record interlaced (I tried 1080i), but only at 30 FPS. It is strongly apparent that the HD60 automatically deinterlaces the video (based off of the output video properties which was set to export at MP4). Major pluses for that.<br /><br />Audio is recorded at around 224 Kbps, with 2 channels (stereo), and with a sampling rate of 48 KHz through HDMI (I was unable to test the 3.5mm jack). Nothing fancy, simple, and sweet. It also allows you to record commentary and audio from HDMI/3.5mm source independently so you can control/modify it in post-production if need be (as long as you don't edit with the built-in software).<br /><br />Livestreaming is extremely computer intensive and your system should be up to par with the mandated specs if you want to, but if your computer can handle it, it's impeccable. Audio control for both game and commentary is astonishing with simple &#34;knobs&#34; with db levels next to them as well as audio monitors. The software is well set up for uploading directly to YouTube and streaming by allowing information for the game you're playing, what level you're on, the title of the video/stream, and the description as well as doing simple tasks like cutting the video and placing it where it needs to be. It's sufficient for say a new YouTube user, but someone more professional or one that yearns for higher quality and options for editing may want better software that can import images and control audio levels post-recording.<br /><br />Lights on the top of the HD60 indicate what is being transmitted to the device and what's happening if you're familiar. I did not have to use it and it tends to be out of sight, but it's helpful if you need to troubleshoot the product for whatever reason or for alerts for if something happens in the software that was unexpected and you can't view it while recording.",2015-08-31

Even a brand new car with a shot out motor is only worth a few hundred bucks. I wanted to rate this higher, but I can't.<br /><br />Please fix this! Swype and keyboard functions are ESSENTIAL.<br /><br />EDIT: it's slow again today, I had to repeat the process.",2015-08-31

It feels a little cheap, but then it IS a very inexpensive cover - so I won't deduct a star for that.  My only deduction is because it isn't available in a tan or brown color.  Also, my cover was shipped in a thin, soft mailer and was deformed (bowed), with bent corners when it arrived.

I'd like to start by saying that I'm not hard on my computer. I never travel long distance with it and it rarely, if ever, leaves my house. A few weeks in to my use two of the little pads on the bottom half of the case, the ones that keep the computer from scratching the surface beneath it, popped off. I was able to superglue them back on and thus far they've held. A month in one of the clips that keeps the bottom case attached completely broke off. Now I have to fight to keep the bottom case on and it's constantly collecting crumbs and other nastiness between the case and my computer. I don't even eat over my laptop, so yeah, gross. I also dinged one corner of the top case when I was moving it from my desk, creating a little crack in the plastic, which has since spread and even chipped off an entire chunk of the case. Nothing like putting duct tape on your computer.<br /><br />To be honest, I think this case is exactly the same as the cases you see here on Amazon for ten or twelve dollars. My mom purchased a case for half the price of the Kuzy and it looks identical (minus the Kuzy logo). I'd hoped that with the slightly steeper price this would have equated to a slightly better quality case, but mine is practically coming apart and my mother's is still in decent condition. In fairness I think the case has done its job at protecting my computer. I can't verify that, though, because I'm pretty sure if I take the case off now it will fall apart.<br /><br />To sum up: if you want a temporary cheap case, buy a cheaper one than this, because honestly it's exactly the same and not worth the extra eight or ten bucks.",2015-08-31

You have come to the right place.","If it seems too good to be true - it usually is!<br /><br />*Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.ility to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive.

Nothing worked so on my 3rd. call to them they suggested a total system reset and assured me that would fix the problem. It didn't. So now I guess I will be sending it back to get a replacement. Asus support is EXCELLENT. It's not their fault the computer is defective. I'm certain I will be able to get a new computer because when I purchased it through Amazon.com it came with a 1 year guarantee against fire, water, dropping, or any other mishap that might happen, plus it's still in warranty. One thing I hate about this computer other than Windows 8.1 is you have to hold down the function key and volume up/down to adjust the volume. Really? Two fingers to adjust the volume? Plus these keys are on opposite ends of the keyboard, a really poor design. The battery life seemed to shorten considerably since I purchased it.

Limited customization options.","The middle button is extremely sensitive. I have mine set to bring up the Start Menu on a double tap, and every bump with my middle finger seems to activate it. It also took me more than twenty minutes to get it to go into pairing mode. The bottom button is extremely difficult to work with, and the &#34;light&#34; that shows it's in pairing mode actually comes on AFTER pairing mode is activated, not AS pairing mode is activated. (In other words, by waiting for the light, I was holding the button on too long, and the mouse was power cycling off.)<br /><br />Kind of annoying that a mouse manufactured by Microsoft IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE MICROSOFT MOUSE AND KEYBOARD CENTER! Seriously, you can't make your own products work together? In order to customize it, you have to download an APP from the Microsoft store. So far, the app ONLY allows you to customize the middle button and scrolling rates/feedback volume. I expected, for a mouse that retails for $64, to be able to set a two or three button click as well.<br /><br />I like that it seems to have less lag than the cheaper Optimal Shop one on my Win10 tablet. It also loses connection less frequently. I like that it flattens out, but the sensitivity of the middle button remains a concern. Hopefully I'll get used to it, or Microsoft will recognize that maybe their products should work together and allow the Keyboard and Mouse center to work with it.",2015-08-31

I have basically spent my entire adult life fabricating, repairing and installing cables of all types. It's a fact that some cables are a cinch to make and others will make you want to tear your hair out. The trick of course is understanding the technique. Easy to say, hard to do sometimes. Instead of reprinting a step-by-step instruction , here are a few tips for those who want to try this.<br /><br />1) After you comb the wire out and order the colors according to the standard you need, cut them all on a diagonal. This will make it easy to insert the wires in the loading bar in the correct order.<br />2) Pay attention to the loading bar (read the review titled &#34;INSTRUCTIONS!!!&#34;  for more info on this<br />3) Check colors one more time and push loading bar down the wire<br />4) Insert into connector and crimp<br />5) Test with Ethernet cable tester (dirt cheap here on Amazon)<br /><br />All said and done it is a tedious process at first but like anything else it gets easier as you get more experience. Prepare to waste a few (dozen) connectors while you are learning the technique.",2015-08-31

Not! 2TB? Not! Nothing good awaits you here. This drive is both counterfeit *AND* fake-capacity.","FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives.<br /><br />The photos show an apparent HP v250w USB Flash Drive, but it is a fake. Genuine HP v250w drives (altually manufactured by PNY) are made to a maximum capacity of 128GB. See &#34;http://www.pny.com.tw/index.php?mode=product_detail&PID=78&#34; for HP v250w product specifications and check for yourself. Any v250w advertised with a higher capacity is one of many Chinese-made counterfeits that have flooded the market.<br /><br />On top of that, counterfeit drives invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low. Read on...<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back. Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive. To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals. Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine formore information.more information.",2015-08-31

I quickly realized that I missed using a standard full-size keyboard and mouse and larger monitor. I was disappointed to find that my HP laptop had no provision for a docking station. During my search I came across this Anker Universal Docking station that uses a computer's USB 3.0 port to replicate ports normally found in a docking station. I was skeptical of this concept because I didn't think USB would provide enough bandwidth for up to two high resolution displays, ethernet, 6 other USB ports and audio. I gave it a shot only because of the reliability and quality of other Anker products I had purchased in the past.<br /><br />Long story short, it has delivered on every promise. My expectations have been surpassed. The product does what they say it will do, it looks good and it was packaged professionally. I am surprised that the computer recognizes all the peripherals connected to it as easily as it would recognize any individual USB device. My laptop happily runs with or without the docking station attached. It makes the transition from dual to single and back to dual displays flawlessly and even jumps between wired ethernet and WIFI automatically. Incidentally, I am running 64-bit Windows 8.1.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this device and am considering purchasing a second one for home use.",2015-08-31

The STRAFE delivers on a few fronts: style, a deep program to customize keys and profiles, great mechanical feel, and quality of build.<br /><br />The contour keys and the blood red LEDs will get your inner Austin Powers to say &#34;I'm dead sexy.&#34; The keys pop out of the keyboard platform like a lift kit on a pickup truck. It is quite the visual. Two LED bars on the rears of the keyboard gives it a nice touch, bold and stylin'.<br /><br />What I like most about the STRAFE is the mechanical feedback. The touch is effortless. A soft touch will press the key. You can &#34;strafe&#34; all day in CSGO with these keys without tiring.  When I'm browsing the web and I have my left hand on the WASD keys by habit, I find myself hitting a bunch of &#34;sssssssssss&#34; because it is so sensitive. I love FPS gaming with this keyboard as well as typing with it. If you're a fast typist and not accommodated to the mechanical &#34;lifted&#34; keys, there may be an adjustment period in which you would curl your fingers a bit more to be able to reach the entire letter keyboard. At work my keyboard is low profile so I tend to lay my fingers a bit flatter. The STRAFE won't really allow that if you're typing.<br /><br />The Corsair software is quite deep. Visit the Corsair website or do a google search. Not difficult to find. The included software includes the ability to check and install firmware updates, change the color profile (pulse, rain, bold), program keystrokes, macros, and change the LED mode.<br /><br />Build quality is top notch - the platform the keys sit on is sturdy, bulky, and doesn't feel hollow. The USB cable is ridiculous thick - 4 Gauge I am estimating. The USB head comes with two well protected usb connections, both of which are required to power this beast. Make sure you have enough spare USB ports. There is also an extra USB port to power your headset, charge devices, etc. It's great for cable management and desktop convenience.<br /><br />I believe the STRAFE is perfect for FPS gamers - no G1 - G20 extra macro keys you'd use for MMOs.  If you don't mind not having the wrist rest and different colored LEDS, the STRAFE is an excellent mechanical keyboard choice.desktop convenience.<br /><br />I believe the STRAFE is perfect for FPS gamers - no G1 - G20 extra macro keys you'd use for MMOs.

Comfort is 10/10. Sound Quality whether listening to music or playing a game 10/10. Price to Worth 20/10. There is some debate whether surround sound is worth it and for this headset it is especially if you play fps games you can clearly tell if someone is behind you or behind you to the right or around the corner. Corsair as a company is great I have 2 headsets with them and both of them broke at one point (not do to faulty material but do to an accident) and the replaced them with the newest version. This is why I do business with corsair first if I can and if I don't like the option I have through them (which hasn't happened yet) I will go spend my money at another company. I have had both headsets for over a year now I believe and the sound quality is the same as when I first got them. Another thing which depending on the situation is a pro or a con, these headphones can double as speakers if you turn them up all the way and set them down you can hear them clear across the house, that doesn't sound like a huge but that is the pro side when you want them on your head you are left with a small amount of wiggle room for adjusting the volume in volume mixer. What is weird though is that the wireless counterpart does not have this feature/issue. A small con worth saying I am a female gamer and this headset occasionally falls off my head at the smallest size it adjusts to was built for a man sized head.",2015-08-31

Most recently the 2012 version of the Nexus 7.  I decided I wanted to go back to the larger 10.1&#34; size,  but wanted to keep the cost low.  After looking around,  reading reviews and specs,  I decided to go with the A10X.<br /><br />Anything written here has to take one thing into account,  and that is:  you get what you pay for.  I spent about $68 for the tablet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*The price.<br />*The wifi is excellent.  I use it a lot for Netflix and Vudu and I'm very happy with the performance.<br />*Along with that,  the quad core A33 processor seems fast.  I have no complaints about what I've seen it do.<br />*Bluetooth works perfectly.  Connected to my headphones with ease.<br />*Though plastic,  it seems to be solidly made,  and is rather lightweight.<br />*A good size,  5000mAh battery.  I don't plug in the charger regularly,  and it's lasted me for a lengthy period.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The screen.  At 1020x600 pixels,  the colors and resolution are miserable.  Viewing angle are,  to put it nicely..... horrible.  Straight on,  the tablet picture isn't bad,  though again,  colors are fairly washed out.<br />*Compatibility.  I've tested some games and they work fine.  On the other hand,  I play The Simpsons: Tapped Out on my other tablet,  and it does nothing but force close on the A10X.  Very annoying.<br />*Charging is through a cable provided,  not the USB,  as with most tablets.  If something happens to the charger,  you can probably find another,  but not as convenient.<br /><br />Is this tablet a bad buy?  Not if you're looking for something that is very low price,  and does the basics.  For someone looking for a first time tablet,  you could find worse.  For a seasoned tablet owner,  you will probable find it lacking.<br /><br />One last note.  Please don't trust reviewers that say they got a review copy and are doing an honest review.  They're not.",2015-08-31

Looks like space somewhat. Shipping was stated to be 1-4 months, but I received this in two weeks. I'm guessing the long estimate is because they don't declare the package delivered until much later than it's arrival. Only had this mouse for a few days and the entire family likes it. Finger ridges for thumb, ring and pinky finger work great. Braided cord is fairly easy to let go of the sharp bends from packaging. Couple of points need to be made clear, though.<br /><br />1.) I can't tell what the DPI settings for this mouse are other than that the highest setting is 2000, but I have four different settings rather than the three stated. Little plus.<br /><br />2.) There is a ridge in the decorated portion of the mouse, running from just under the DPI button all the way down to the bottom. The point at the bottom of the mouse in the picture can help clarify. The ridge juts upward slightly, so it's nearly impossible to hold this with a flat palm comfortably. Shift your palm to the left a little when setting your hand down and it will be fine.<br /><br />3.) The colors on mine cycle. Yeah, BIG plus on aesthetics. Starts off at red, then green, and yada yada. There must be two different LED's or something inside, because there's a different cycle rate for different areas of the mouse. The scroll wheel and thumb buttons eventually become uncoordinated with the &#34;Weyes&#34; emblem and the lines on either side. Three different rectangles at the bottom back of the mouse usually show the color of the logo, but when it's red there is a bit of bleeding from the scroll wheel color on the right of the middle rectangle. I personally don't care about the change in cycle rate, I think it's a cool defect if anything<br /><br />4.) The scroll wheel feels cheap and actual scrolling quality leaves something to be desired. When scrolling very fast, the sensor tends to read your scroll in the opposite direction i.e. if you're scrolling down the page will start to go up. Certain games such as Waframe seem to really pronounce this problem. For games, I would program any &#34;next&#34; or &#34;previous&#34; options to the front and back keys. Scroll wheel click is fine<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong with this mouse. The edge and scroll wheel are barely even cons. Shipping time is a bit long if you get used to a five day max but not a deal breaker at all. Give this a go; you won't regret it.f you're scrolling down the page will start to go up.

I also happen to have a pretty favorable view of the Google gadgets I've used so far: the Nexus phones and tablets, Chromebooks and the Chromecast. And Google's Chrome is the default browser on my Windows laptop. If this could indicate some bias well... I am always trying to be fair and objective when evaluating a new product and I jumped at the opportunity to try out Google's OnHub because it's the first Google router so it's something new. What follows are my impressions.<br /><br />By the way, I've used, tested and evaluated a number of routers in the past, mostly Netgear, TP-Link and Linksys and a few off-brand models.<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSIONS<br /><br />The first thing that you will notice when taking the OnHub out of the box is how pretty it is. Many routers that I've used including my current Netgear Nighthawk look good but near all of them have the industrial good looks and are meant to be kept out of sight, preferably in the basement. OnHub is living room pretty because Google wants you to keep it some place near the center of your house so that everybody could get a good signal. I would love to be able to take my router out of the basement but it wouldn't be so easy for me because that's where out Internet tap happens to be but, anyone whose Internet connection is in the living quarters would have a good reason to be happy with the OnHub because it should feel like it belonged on a bookshelf or some other visible place. My unit has a dark blue skin but it's removable and easily replaceable and I suspect that alternative shells will be available in the future.<br /><br />Now, for the setup, this 802.11ac device is designed to do most of the dirty setup work by itself, out of sight and out of mind because most of us have better things to do. It's done through an Android or iOS app and it's as simple and friendly as any router setup has ever been, couple of minutes to set it up. Once operational, the app tells me who/what is connected to my networks, how much bandwidth is taken by each device, even how good a bandwidth I have. For example, it advised me to ask my provider for a higher bandwidth service because what I have now was not good enough to support Ultra HD.<br /><br />Operation can be super-easy if you only want to do the basic things. Should be able to allow others to remotely manage the router through the phone app but I didn't try it yet. On the finer points, there is no QoS (quality of service) per se but you can reserve bandwidth to certain devices if needed. No parental control features yet. And, something that I wish it was there, I wasn't able to assign different network names for the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz bands which is what I currently have on my other router setup. One network name to rule them all is good from an ease of use point of view but it would be better if the one network setting was the default but we still had the ability to segregate the bands if we chose to do so. Operation/control is overall 'good' for most users and I suspect it's only going to get better as the software gets updates and more features are supported.<br /><br />As for performance, it's almost as good as our current router but that is a more expensive beast and a more mature product so, no surprises there. I can't place the OnHub anywhere other than the basement but I could easily connect a signal booster to it and everything was good and smooth. For anyone who cares about tech details, this router has 13 (thirteen!) antennas, half a dozen each for the 2.4GHz and  5GHz bands with the 13th beaming a strong signal and, allegedly, constantly attempting to detect an overcrowded channel in use and switch you off of it. It's expected to support Bluetooth in the future but not now. Also noted that it comes with 4GB of internal storage. The USB port can't be used to attach anything to it at this time.<br /><br />For ports... well... this is supposed to bea near-pure Wi-Fi router so there aren't too many. Besides the unusable USB port and Ethernet in and Ethernet out and that's just about it. Didn't try to attach anything to USB but I did successfully expand/split the Ethernet port by attaching a small switch to it.<br /><br />MY RATING AND EVALUATION<br /><br />The OnHub gets an excellent (5 stars) rating for its looks and ease of setup and operation. Without exaggerating much, anyone who can use a phone should have no problem whatsoever setting up and operating this router. The Android app is friendly and, while not providing too many details on the router's operation upfront, it manages to keep me informed about things that I really care such as bandwidth utilization and who's connected to the router at any given time.<br /><br />Signal strength is good. I won't say that better than our Nighthawk's but, had we had the ability to place the OnHub in a more central area in the house, we would have had a stronger signal. The 13 antennas are internal, by the way, so there's no need to optimally  position them by hand and that does add to the 'ease of use' aspect.<br /><br />My main beef at this time is the lack of physical ports. Wi-Fi routers, traditionally, come with 4 Ethernet ports and a couple of USBs. Yes, most of the devices in our house are wireless but, believe it or not, some do need or at least benefit greatly from a wired attachment. In our case there's a VoIP box, a NAS (network attached storage) and a Powerline adapter wired-connected and that's 3 ports. The 4th is taken by a mini-router we had to use because our iFit-ready treadmill would not talk to the main router but was able to connect to the mini-router. Yes, you can plug in a Hub but that kind of defeats the goal of 'few wires' and slightly complicates everything.<br /><br />My current rating is 4 stars, with one star deducted for the lack of (needed) physical ports, for the lack of an interface that would give an almost-geek like me more control over the settings and for what I would say is too high a price.a near-pure Wi-Fi router so there aren't too many.

Upgraded from a Cyborg Rat7 that I had for years, and this mouse has done exactly what the Rat7, plus a few other things.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to use: The Corsair interface is really simple. It will give you 3 menus, DPI, LIGHTING, PROFILE. You use DPI to adjust the sensitivity, and can have 5 different sensitivities bound to each profile, that you switch between with the colored dot right behind the mouse wheel. Lightning you use to color code your mouse however you like, even has a rainbow option. Profile is were you select which profile to use, which the profile is just your saved DPI setting and color coding, and I find that I like to keep a very high DPI for my desktop, and 3 varying speeds for different games, so 1 profile was enough for me, but you can have as many as you like.<br /><br />Sniper Button: I really enjoy the sniper button on the left side of the mouse, I use it all the time when I play CSGO to help me watch a hallway with a scoped gun, I tend to twitch before I shoot a bit when my nerves get high so its nice to have to lower the twitch.<br /><br />2 Extra mouse buttons: While 2 isnt a whole lot for when I play RPGs and make good use of the keymapping, the 2 it gives are a big plus for simple things games with multiple alt_fire buttons.<br /><br />Cons: I haven't run into any yet, and am just passing the 6th month mark.<br /><br />Overall its a very good mouse for shooters, especially at the price",2015-08-31

My laptop is actually only 11.6&#34; So I had a lot of wiggle room in mine. At first I thought it might have been too big, but reading the many comments on here talking about how they ordered the 15-15.6&#34; one but it didn't fit their 15.6&#34; laptop, I was kind of glad that I got the bigger sized one. Here are some of the things I like and dislike about this:<br /><br />Liked:<br />-Design: I thought the design was cute, but not &#34;girly&#34;. I like that its gender neutral.<br />-Extra Bag: I like that it came with a matching adapter bag, but unfortunately it was too small to fit my charger for the laptop, it however fit my mouse just fine.<br />-Quality: I'd say overall quality of the material, stitching, etc. is good. You do have to consider this is FELT. So for felt, this is pretty thick. Its thicker than your typical craft felt. You cannot compare it to things such as leather or vinyl.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />-All Felt Fabric: Please note that this is ALL felt! When it says &#34;felt & real leather' the &#34;real leather&#34; part is just that orange strap going down the middle you see in the picture. It serves no purpose. The case itself is felt inside and out. There is no additional lining on the inside, it is that exact same grey felt you see in the picture in and out.<br />-Single Magnetic Closure: Obviously with this design you can see which end is up pretty easily but in case you pick this up upside-down by accident, the closure is not as secure as a zipper one. I don't think the one magnetic clasp is strong enough to prevent the laptop from falling out.<br />-Narrow: My laptop is about .50&#34; thick, and once I close the clasp it didn't poke up or anything but this is a very narrow &#34;pouch&#34;, and I can see thicker laptops not fitting. There is a second pocket on the inside right above the main pocket but because this pouch is so thin I can't see you being able to put anything in that pocket unless its paper.<br /><br />I don't travel too much with my laptop so this case works for me. Its just something to put my laptop in so it doesn't collect dust on my desk. If you are looking for something that really does a good job &#34;protecting&#34; then I don't think this is it. But for light use, I think its fine.<br /><br />(*I purchased this item with my own money at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion)",2015-08-31

The mouse has rubber grips on each side if the mouse, making long sessions of mouse usage feel very comfortable even after several hours of use. As always, the bundle does have its flaws, such as the keys being very hard to distinguish when the backlight is on, the mouse LED cannot be toggled, and in order for the keyboard's LEDs to turn on, scroll lock must always be activated, which could cause some problems with certain programs.

Typing on this is easy, however there are a few keys that have more surface area than actual button underneath and they make a semi-loud clack noise. The spacebar and backspace seem to have the domes under them placed in a weird spot. I have not attempted to remove any keys yet. The keys do not feel odd, their faces are uniform and I rarely notice the etching for the letter on the top.<br /><br />The backlight is very bright, visible under normal room lights. There is an option to dim them as well, for 3 levels of brightness and an off position, however you need to cycle through these, there is no on/off.<br /><br />The plastic on the wrist area is slightly textured, giving it a bit of a rubber feel, but it is not sticky. I kinda wish the clear plastic border for the board wasn't there, but that's a personal aesthetic desire.<br /><br />The feet don't raise up the keyboard too much, maybe a half inch. The feet themsleves are small, but the have the same rubber on the tips as the boards other feet do, and it is very slide resistant.<br /><br />I have been using this for gaming and notice no ghosting issues. I do not believe this keyboard has anti ghosting, but it has not been an issue. I play shooters, rpgs and many other types of games with no issue.<br /><br />It works well with the Logitech keyboard software, I like the feedback HUD whenever I push caps lock on accident, it is a nice large transparent square at the bottom of my screen. I believe this might be able to be customized, however I left it as default.<br /><br />I'm hoping to keep this keyboard for years and years, just like their other hardware purchases that I have made.",2015-08-31

Completely undoes the beauty of the design. In general, I'm quite bemused by Apple design. I believe that function is as vital as beauty, and that the two must go hand in hand. Early iPhones with exquisite forms and plastic backs that scratch so easily that they must be hidden in those ghastly jelly cases? The sleekly elegant Mac mini that comes with no peripherals built in and only a few USB slots, so you need to add a big USB hub and an ugly tangle of cables for the back-up drive, keyboard, mouse, speakers, CD player, card reader, photo and laser printers. Enough of my Apple rant. The keyboard is smudged and glorious.",2015-08-31

I tap the link but it's not selected and not gone-to.

Straight out of the box, the router was easy to set up and everything was clearly labeled. I got the router up and running connected within about 10 minutes. The only problem I did have was figuring out where to change the passwords since I didn't want to leave any default password settings and have people jump on my network. It took me a few minutes to get used to the interface of the network manager but finally found it. I apparently mistyped the admin password when I was changing it (there was only 1 field and no confirmation of entering the password again to ensure they are the same) and I ended up going on the internet trying to find how to reset to the default password and get it up and running again.

The method in which to apply then is a little extensive and the numbers on my products were backwards from the picture but getting the jist of the method was not difficult to figure it out. The material is not a completely clear film but rather has a slight frost to it. This doesn't effect the ability to see through it clearly once applied and I guess is what allows it to have it fingerprintless quality. It doesn't bother me one bit and I love not seeing fingerprints all over my screen. I would not hesitate to purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend!!",2015-08-31

The back rotates and locks into position for viewing at different angles. The detents that lock the back are set approximately 15 degrees apart, so there's a good choice of viewing angles. The stand is small (3.9\\""x3.5\\""x1.4\\"") and lightweight (6.05 ounces), so it's easily portable enough for carrying in a bag or purse.<br /><br />I used the stand with my smartphone and my Kindle Fire HDX 7\\"" tablet. My smartphone is in a thin rubberized case that fit in the curved slot at the base of the stand. The tablet is in a slimline cover that fit in the slot, but I think that many tablets would have to be removed from a cover to fit. If the rubber-lined slot at the base of the stand isn't wide enough, the rubber insert is easily removed to increase the size of the slot. Both the phone and the tablet worked well in the portrait and landscape orientations. The stand is heavy enough and sturdy enough to work with larger tablets without tipping over - I tried it with a 10\\"" tablet, and it was fine. Note that the product description indicates that the foldout can be adjusted to an angle precision of 1 degree. However, it appeared to me that the detents that lock the back into position are set about every 15 degrees.<br /><br />This is a very handy stand for smartphones and tablets. It's sturdy, and it's small enough and light enough to carry easily in a purse or backpack. The stand is ideal for supporting a phone or tablet in a position for viewing videos or Skyping. It's also an excellent way to hold a phone or tablet while using a wireless keyboard.<br /><br />The adjustable stand was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.",2015-08-31

I originally bought the &#34;red rose map&#34; case in August of 2015. When one of the corners cracked last week, I decided to purchase another one, so I got the &#34;magic forest/spring tree&#34; case.<br /><br />Note: I contacted Omoton and the are replacing the red rose map case at no cost... Great customer service! It's good to have a backup so I'm glad a ordered a new one too!<br /><br />To compare the two cases:<br /><br />The red rose map one has a harder, more rigid case. The inside is a soft, fuzzy material that keeps the kindle from getting scratched. The design is pretty and the kindle fits perfectly, flush with the case. It has a magnet closure that sticks out a little on the right so you can easily open the case. No sharp edges. The corner mysteriously cracked though, but again the company offered to replace at no cost since the case wasn't dropped or anything. The case is light and the outside is sightly textured.<br /><br />The &#34;magic forest/spring tree&#34; case isn't as rigid... More rubbery than just hard plastic, apparently because this is an &#34;updated&#34; case and the rubber is supposed to prevent the case from scratching the kindle, though I didn't have that issue with the harder case. The inside is a soft material, the kindle fits perfectly, flush with the case, and it closes with a magnet. The case doesn't jut out at all, but it's easy enough to open. The case feels a little heavier than the red rose map case, and the material feels softer without sacrificing protection.<br /><br />The wake/sleep function works perfectly, opening and closing the case, and both cases are pretty, fit my 7th gen kindle perfectly, and are very pretty!<br /><br />I've very happy with this company and the cases, and I'm glad they stand by their products!",2015-08-31

The way I did it was start from one of the edge ( the one near to me) and peeled the backing about 2 inches, aligned from the edge of the MBP, have somebody just lightly press the tntire length on the edge.  Then when seemingly it looks alighned, I started running my fingers pressing the skin, much like how a printer printed on paper, slowly edge to edge.  Then, peeled off another 2 inches, then run my finger again edge to edge.  I kept doing the is until the end. So I didn't need to used the tool that came with it and there were no bubbles.

I love the fact that the cables come in different colors as it is easy for my kids and myself to recognize which charger is ours.  The feel of the cable is very nice and they are very flexible.  However, for our Kindle Fires and for my phone I have fast chargers.  When I replace this cable (while still using the fast charging power adapters) with either Kindle's fast charger cable or my phone's fast charger cable I get a notification stating that my device is connected to a low power charger.  Interestingly enough if I replace the cables back to the originals that came with the devices my chargers function fast as expected.  I'm not sure how or why these cables are causing that issue but it is a pain unless we are charging them overnight while we are sleeping since they aren't in use.  Another issue we encountered was these cables not holding a snug fit into the devices we used them on and they were easy to fall out of the port.  Overall these cables aren't bad but they certainly aren't the best.

The quality is quite good although it came with a very wide &#34;null zone&#34; which means there is a very large neutral area where the X and Y axis do not move at all (pitch and roll in an airplane). This is not normal in any other joystick/Yoke since most of them replicate a real airplane yoke which in real life have a little or almost no &#34;null zone&#34;. After adjusting any possible option in X-plane software I called tech support who offered me good help but no other solution that to send it back in order to be repaired under warranty.<br />Reading other past reviews I realized that this issue is an old one (over 3 years old issue) and I can´t understand why Saitek has not addressed it yet!<br />If we leave aside the &#34;large null zone&#34; issue in X and Y axis, the unit has an excellent quality and good functionality. The three lever control is smooth and works awesome.<br />Saitek/Mad Catz: I think it is time for you to review your program code in the internal electronics! This is not a potentiometer or mechanical issue but a firmware  issue. Please check other threads about this issue which has been solved by other users using bypassing the original USB controller and using an alternate controller with excellent results (Leo Bodnar´s BU836A 12 Bit Joystick Controller.",2015-08-31

The thin bezels are great for multi-monitor setups, also the two HDMI<U+200B> ports make it great for having them used as for multiple purposes such as sometimes Xbox and sometimes connecting your desktop or laptop to it. The speakers are ok as far as monitor speakers, although the difference from volume 1 and volume 100 is not substantially different. The monitor stands that these arrive with are relatively weak but work.  The light weight makes them very portable and I've personally brought it to many friends house to play and it is very easy to set back up.  The picture quality is great and gaming on them is amazing.

Clearly designed by morons.","The product arrived on time and appeared to be the same one pictured.<br />1.)The biggest issue is that the clear portion of the screen protector was designed very poorly by morons who were unaware or did not care what the actual touch screen size is. You cannot access the drop down menu by swiping the top of the screen, you can't access notifications, clock, etc. AT ALL, you cannot access the quick side menu that allows you to return home or to another open app, and if your apps have any need to you to swipe from the edge of the screen, forget about it. This case is nice if you're going to watch a video and not touch the screen. If you want a protector that allows you to have a protected, functional and usable fire tablet, this is NOT the one for you. It was clearly designed by idiots who did not even check their product specifications to see how much of the touch screen has to be visible in order to use your tablet at all.<br />2.) Don't fool yourself though, this isn't 100% waterproof. I dropped the tablet into a sink with water into it while reading a recipe, did NOT fully submerge the tablet, and while the tablet functions, the inside of the case was dripping wet. If I hadn't opened the case quickly and aired out the tablet, who knows what kind of water damage, mold, mildew might have ensued.<br />3.) The casing around the speakers muffles the sound so it is barely audible at full volume, and actually buzzes a lot louder than the sound you are trying to hear. Again, some genius product engineers at work here, can't even make a speaker cover that doesn't buzz louder than your music.<br />Overall, I would NOT buy this product again. I recommend you look elsewhere. If what you're looking for is a protective case that will protect your device from water and drops AND leave your device functional enough for even casual use, this is NOT the product for you.<br />The only way the company could possibly adjudicate this issue would be to redesign the case with more competent engineers and provide a free new design model to everyone who threw away their money on a case that renders their touchscreen edge useless, fails to protect from A HALF INCH of water, and renders their speakers unusable. Anything short of providing a free redesigned product would be highway robbery. Don't buy this. Do yourself a favor.",2015-08-31

For only $4.95 with no tax or shipping to pay, the only thing that made it better was that I had a gift card to pay it with.<br /><br />I cannot give it 5 stars because the ports are touchy.

On the previous model I was using I had to remove the battery cover to access the holder slot for the receiver.<br /><br />So I ordered this unit.  When I got it, it just felt cheap and not as well made as the previous mouse.  It takes two AAA batteries instead of the standard single AA all my other mice had.  The on/off button is recessed so you have to use a pocket knife to turn it on and off.  For someone that uses this mouse for their bag turning it on and off is a requirement and always having to pull out the pocket knife or find a sharp object to turn it off is not always practical.  After setup the right and left mouse buttons would not work.  It was just not what I expected.  So I dinged it 2 stars for those things.

This is not my first Samsung SSD - I have a perfectly functional Samsung 840 Pro 500GB installed on my own laptop.<br /><br />The drive hardware is quite fine. The adjunct software is absolute junk. Let me recount the experience step by step (and some solutions too).<br />1. First attached the drive using an external Sabrent enclosure to the laptop. The Windows 10 and the Samsung Data Migration refused to recognize the drive. For a drive that is $175 or so, I am surprised that this converter cable did not come with the pack.<br />2. Then attached the drive to a desktop (Windows 8.1 Pro) as an internal drive. Windows recognized and initialized the drive properly.<br />3. Then fixed back the drive using the same external enclosure to the laptop, now Windows 10 recognized the drive, but Samsung Data Migration Tool did not find the SSD.<br />4. A few long wait time calls and I was informed by Samsung that Samsung Data migration does NOT work on Windows 10 - and the very helpful team could not name any product that would migrate the data - and finally suggested that I roll back to Windows 8.1 !<br />5. I installed a Macrium Reflect Free software and it indicated that Windows 10 installation has 5 partitions (last two made for some additional recovery). But the software will not migrate from a 1TB hard disk (only 261 GB used) to a 500 GB hard disk because, well, because of no reason.<br />6. Shrank the data partition in the hard disk to 505 GB (would not go any below), then deleted the page file - since it is usually immovable, and then tried to copy only the first three partitions. This worked with a note from the Macrium software that my data partition is being shrunk slightly.<br />7. Once this step got over, I further shrank the data partition in the SSD by an additional 1 GB to make space for the last two partitions.<br />8 Finally, again used the Macrium SW to copy the lasttwo recovery partitions made by Windows 10.<br />9 Replaced the HDD with the SSD, and then restored the page file size to System default. Removed the Macrium Free SW as it was being detected as &#34;adware&#34; by Malwarebytes.<br /><br />The SSD drive since then is working perfectly. I am absolutely certain that this migration would qualify as an harrowing experience to most people. If Samsung cannot offer a Windows 10 Data migration tool, then perhaps it should withdraw the drive from the market till it has a tool to offer, or make a serious note about it on their website. Honestly, they should also consider shutting down their helpline - its about as helpful as the FCC warning label on the box enclosure of the disk - costs money, achieves nothing.<br />I have not had the courage to run the other SW that came along with - Samsung Magician - as am quite wary of these.",2015-08-31

I very highly recommend it. It is not perfect, but if I were to give it a rating out of ten it would be somewhere in the line of a 8/10. I've used this keyboard for about half a year and I love it. Below I will list the pros and cons of it and what kind of a person should buy this keyboard.<br />Pros:<br />-FREAKING SOLAR! Works well even in low light rooms.<br />-NO batters because of solar. It's hard to explain how nice this is until you own the thing.<br />-Has a build in solar level indicator<br />-Has the ability to manually turn the keyboard on and off from a switch built into the keyboard<br />-Has fairly good range. I personally have not had any trouble using it, even though two different desks<br />-Nice shortcut keys for PC Power, Volume control, Calculator shortcut, as well as E-Mail and Search shortcuts<br />-No cords on your desk surface :)<br />Cons:<br />-Not a super sturdy construction, only meant as a relatively fixed keyboard on your desk<br />-Plastic surface gets easily scratched and like many other keyboards, it's not the easiest thing to clean. &#60;--These are my biggest issues<br />-Chiclet Keys which may not be your thing, they work great for me and typing feels comfortable so its hard to put this as a con<br /><br />So who should buy this keyboard? This keyboard works well for an office computer as well as an in home computer for general use. It can be used for gaming (I do some light gaming on it. Occasional Skyrim, Minecraft, Age of Empires, Ect) although it obviously is not a gaming keyboard. It also is not for those who like more traditional keys on their keyboard. As I mentioned earlier it does have the more chicklet styled keys. If you are using this for general use computing I can't recommend it enough. The money you can save from battery powered keyboards and the niceness of not having another cord run across your desk is WELL worth the purchase of this keyboard.",2015-08-31

At least once a week, it encounters a problem and shuts down while I have important things open that I'm working on (this has been happening since I got it from the box).  This is probably the biggest issue.  Besides that, several drivers have had to be reinstalled since I bought it, just a few months ago.  The touchscreen is really too heavy for the keyboard, and as a result it tends to fall backward on any soft surface (like my lap), and is very tippy on hard surfaces too.  The touchscreen is okay...but it tends to be a bit &#34;sticky&#34;.  It's not glass like most smartphones are, so my finger tends to drag and leave smudges much more easily, and after a while of using it, the touchscreen gets jumpy and buggy because of this.  It also makes it hard to be precise with the touchscreen.  The power button is quite difficult to use as well - sometimes if it's on sleep, I press it and the computer comes back immediately.  Other times, I press it and nothing happens after a few moments, so I end up pressing it a few times trying to make it come back to life and the computer inevitably ends up restarting itself (again a pain).  Also, and this is such a tiny issue, but has bugged me - about two weeks after I got it, one of the rubber feet fell off the bottom, so now it's a bit lopsided, even though it's still quite new.  All in all, this is just not HP's best offering at all.",2015-08-31

In other words  it was quiet. A nice feature is the ability to change the speed of the fans. Personally I think this is more likely to be set once and left alone, rather than changed when your machine gets hot, but that is great as different machines run hotter than others.<br /><br />Cons: Unlike some laptop coolers this one is not conducive to using on your lap, the design of the 'feet' make it a little uncomfortable on your legs.  Like a lounge chair it has an adjustable back so that you can have your laptop at the angle that is most comfortable for you.

I have done a build with the original Challenger case, and was impressed.<br />This one impressed me more though.<br />The main thing I love about this is the roomy width it offers, while being a bit shorter. I do not like the hugeness of full towers. This is one of the shortest mid towers that I could find at 16 &#34; high.<br />The extra room that the side panels offer is awesome, as it not only allows more cable management, but air cooling options are phenomenal.<br />I first threw a CM Hyper Evo 212 in this, and was impressed at the space I still had.....<br />So, I measured and took a chance to try the Noctua nh-d15s (probably the biggest air cooler you can buy).<br />And it fit!<br />I have been changing out things on this case for 2 months now, and find it very easy to work with for it's size.<br />I have changed out the fans, as I am a silence freak.<br />The fans that came with it were actually quieter than a few fans that I replaced them with, until I went with Corsair Quiets.<br />This does not mean the Rosewill fans were loud. This means I am a silence freak.<br /><br />PROS: Great looking design.<br />Will fit under any desk.<br />The size of this thing is perfect for those who don't want a tank under their desk.<br />You can add so many fans, it would be overkill.<br />Fits largest air cooler I could find!<br />Fits big graphics &#34;cards&#34;.

I paired this with a Samsung 850 Pro SSD (OS / boot drive), WD Black 3TB 7200 rpm hard drive, Intel Core i7-4790 running stock,  Noctua cooler [[ASIN:B00TBHYYFK Noctua Premium Quality Quiet CPU Cooler for Intel 1150 Socket NH-U9S]],32 GB of GSkill ARES DDR3 2400 RAM, 550 Watt Seasonic power supply.   It's screaming fast.  I am spoiled.   I can have many multimedia windows open and nothing stutters or breaks a sweat (CPU hovers at 50 degrees C , 122 degrees F)  My rig is near silent.  The BIOS is very posh... the graphics, navigation, etc.  I have never had so much information, setting choices (and decent EXPLANATIONS regarding setting choices) BUT!  --&#62; You are ** not **  forced to use all that info it you don't want it.  Just set the time, take the defaults.  It's all good.  For Overclockers and those who want to fuss with settings:  You ** could ** spend most of your adult life manually tweaking the plethora of RAM and CPU parameters here.  I can't be bothered with that, but it's certainly there for those who want it.  OTHER COOL THINGS:  The slot spacings are wide enough you are unlikely to have component spacing conflicts.  There are dual LED hexadecimal readouts that give you codes you can look up to see why something might not be working.  Aside from the excellent functionality, did I mention that it looks flat out great?  MSI gives you two USB 2.0, six USB 3.0 and 2 (two) USB 3.1 jacks, so..those who can't afford a USB hub to begin with have a generous supply of USB ports to work with .  The 3.1 jacks were a deciding factor to me - future proofing without taking up a card slot.  It has an M2 socket but I passed on that.  If you use the MD2 socket, it will eat up Sata connectors 7 and 8.  There is a single PS2 connector that supposedly can be used for either Keyboard or mouse.  (Yes PS2 is ancient but some people have beautiful PS2 input hardware they don't want to part with justyet.).  I didn't bother with the onboard video but you are given a lot of connectors for that.  For audio, I'm using an external DAC but, if I wasn't, the Realtek sound chips have gotten so good that it wouldnt be a bad solution.  The built in Ethernet networking (NIC) is the &#34;Killer&#34; (brand) licensed hardware.  I don't game anymore really so I can't speak to if it's any faster than an Intel NIC but it certainly delivers solid, zippy performance.  I declare this board a winner.  I didn't buy it here at Amazon but I can certainly recommend it.  ADDENDUM:  I got some RAM DISK software and created a 2GB RAM BOOT DISK.   You have to wait a bit for the boot to happen but Gads!  the surfing is blazing fast now.     Very please with how things turned out.",2015-08-31

It sounds impressive, but there just isn’t much practical use for it just yet.

I read a few good reviews outside of Amazon and decided to try the ZyXEL out after seeing the price drop.<br /><br />I've had plenty of experience with ZyXEL firewalls but never tried any of their wireless products.

"7145","US",17777294,"R6NYQVLC6K25B","B00ZFI6ZHE",250789598,"AMNIE AE-CP1501 15.6""-17"" Laptop Cooler - Four Quiet 160mm Fans at 1,200RPM, Ultra-portable and Light Weight (4 Fans)","PC",3,9,9,"N","Y","Decent but lacking for larger or warmer laptops","I believe that this cooling stand will work quite well for some and so I urge you to know what you are purchasing and read both specs and reviews to determine whether you fall into that category.  That being said, I see both positives and negatives to this design and I'll give my impressions based on having tested several laptop coolers over the years.  To begin with, I almost always use a cooling stand when doing any real work as I am running a high end graphics laptop that runs on the warmer side (with a high end graphics and two HDD's) and is housed in an aluminum case.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The stand is relatively sturdy.  It is a mixture of some type of metal and plastic.  It is heavy enough not to feel cheap and light enough not to be off-putting.  The fans are fairly large and for the most part cover each of the corners to the middle of the stand giving it a large area of coverage (for fan effectiveness, please continue reading below).<br /><br />The stand comes with a standalone braided usb cable (which should help with wear and tear) which gives plenty of reach from the back of the stand where the USB inputs are to any USB input on your laptop.  You will also find the fan controls on the back of the stand near the USB inputs.  There is cord management on the bottom center of the stand which is convenient as the USB used to power the stand is not connected permanently on one side and could get lost otherwise.<br /><br />There are two retractable kickstand-like feet on the bottom of the stand that are meant to keep the fans off whatever surface the stand is resting on.  This is a great feature as it increases air flow around the fans on the bottom of the stand which is especially important if you're using this, for example, on your bed on top of a comforter which would leave no space between the bottom of the stand and the material.  These &#34;feet&#34; are plastic and while they seem sturdy, I wonder how well they would do with a larger and heavier laptop over the long run. There are also two feet on the top of the laptop (the side that the laptop sits on) which are smaller and also made of plastic.  There is no documentation with the stand to explain what these two smaller feet are for and I can only assume it's to counter the slant that is created by the feet on the bottom of the stand (basically, it helps the laptop to sit more flat relative to the surface the cooling stand is on).  I've not seen this feature on any of the cooling stands I've used before and I think that it is a smart idea as I do not always want a significant slant when typing as it can cause discomfort in one's wrists (see more on this below).<br /><br />Finally, the 12-month warranty the AMNIE offers is a very nice feature and I appreciate a company standing behind their products.  Could it be longer?  Any warranty could always be longer, but I believe at this price point $25-$30, a one-year warranty is absolutely appropriate and one could even argue it's more than appropriate when many electronic components come with 90-day warranties.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I found the dimensions of this product to be less than 16&#34; x 11&#34; (and the dimensions are actually listed as slightly bigger than that online).  I wish that I had taken a picture of this before returning the product, but I was more concerned with getting a product that would work for my needs as soon as possible.  This was a significant issue for me as the description states that it supports a 17&#34; laptop, which I have (I actually pulled out a measuring tape and measured the length and width prior to ordering for this very reason).  Had the measurements been spot on, it would have fit perfectly, however it does not.  The irregular shape of the stand also adds to issue because a slight overhand is compounded in the areas where the shape angles in towards the center of the stand (in the middle of each side).<br /><br />With regards to the two retractable kickstand-like feet on the bottom of the stand, as I mention above, I wonder how well they would do with a larger and heavier laptop over time.  With regards to the two smaller feet on the top of the stand, I quickly found a design fault.  Being that they are smooth plastic and most bottoms on laptop are metal or some other smooth surface, there is absolutely no traction/friction and a laptop could easily side off of these feet if, for example, it was accidentally bumped or while you are moving the stand and laptop.  It would have been a simple addition to add a rubber-like pad or some other material/coating on the end of those feet which would create friction.  This is a real surprising oversight on the designer's part.  Unfortunately, I did not take note of whether this issue exists on the bottom set of feet.  However, I feel that this would be less of an issue due to the fact that the feet are larger and therefore have a larger surface area and also have the weight of the stand and the laptop bearing down on them which would impact their stability in this area.<br /><br />This is personal preference of course, and I will explain why, but I feel that the stand-alone USB power cable is less than ideal.  I truly disliked the fact that the cable used to power the stand, a USB cable, is not connected permanently to the cooling stand.  You might conclude that not being permanently connection makes it easier to pack up and store and not worry about damaging the connection, but if it were permanently attached, there is no need to have such a vulnerable connection.  The connection could be made internally and the only thing protruding would be a malleable cable with one usb connection.  This is a design choice of course, but it could become problematic because it makes the cable easier to lose.  How many times have you lost or forgotten a cable?  But &#34;what about the included cable management&#34; you ask?  How many times have you packed up for the night and didn't put everything away because youwere in a hurry or [insert any number of excuses here]. Sure, you can replace this cable, but it is one more expense and it would be a definite inconvenience.  Also, again there is the increased chance of damaging the male and female USB components at the stand connection point where there is normally only one (if that cable was internally connected as it is on my current, time tested, laptop cooler).<br /><br />Finally, perhaps most important (aside from the size issue because if it doesn't fit, what's the point?) is the effectiveness of the fans.  As I mentioned previously, I have a laptop that runs warm and sometimes downright hot.  If you have a laptop that runs warm-hot, I do not believe this will work for you.  I found the fan output to be very week when leaving my hand next to them.  That being said, it appeared to keep the surface of the stand (which I believe, if I remember correctly, was some sort of metal) a relatively neutral temperature.  So, it's not entirely ineffective, but I can say with certainty that it is not equipped to deal with a laptop that runs quite warm.  In case there are any naysayers who will try to make the argument that a laptop shouldn't run that warm/hot and that is a bigger issue, that's really neither here nor there.  Some laptops run like that and have since the day they were first powered up.  As I said, this cooler isn't ineffective, it's just not going to be effective enough for certain laptops.  Also, my GPU is located in the upper left corner of my laptop (under the Escape key essentially) and so I need more cooling in that area than anywhere else.  In fact, the rest of my laptop is almost always room temperature.  So, I was taking a leap of faith with this cooler stand, hoping that the decent fan coverage in the corners would be enough to do the job...Unfortunately, it wasn't.  Since the lighting that accompanies the fan operation is completely unnecessary, I would only make sense to cut out the fancy unnecessary blue lighting and use the extra power to amp up the fan output.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The AMNIE AE-CP1501 appears to be well built for its price.  If you have a laptop less than 16&#34; you should be fine with regards to product dimensions and for the average laptop (not build for serious graphics work or gaming) it will likely do a decent job cooling your machine.  In that case, I'd say that if you like the way this looks and the price is right, give it a shot.  If you have a 17&#34;+ laptop, I believe that you'll find it runs a bit short which makes managing both the laptop and the cooling stand a bit much and as it is an irregular shape (not a rectangle, but with several additional angles added in for show as opposed to increase air flow), it makes that even more cumbersome.  I ended up returning the product and ordering the newest version of the cooling stand I had purchased twice over the last 5 years [[ASIN:B00ED3WMTC Cooler Master NotePal U3 PLUS - Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad with 3 Moveable High Performance Fans (Black)]]).  The only reason I purchased something else (the AMNIE cooler) was because I was looking for an alternative that did not come with a fixed incline, but I suppose I learned not to mess with what isn't broken as everything else on it perfectly for my needs and also came with an extended warranty.",2015-08-31

Let me explain why.<br />First the price. It's a deal with this config, Intel I-5, DVD player, 8 Gb RAM, 1 Tb HDD.<br />For this price, of course I did not expect a SSD, but in a few months, if prices drop down, I may swap the HDD for a SSD.<br />I won't say anything about Windows 10 because, so far I don't see what is better than Windows 7 that I used with my former laptop. On the contrary, it takes some time to do correct settings if one wants to avoid all the spying which is activated by default.<br />The laptop seems reasonably happy with 8 Gb RAM. Windows 10 starts in less than 30', including a password.  I installed several of my favorite programs, including Microsoft Office and everything works fine.<br />Some people don't like the keyboard (rubber feeling) but for me it's not really a problem. Yes it reminds me of the first Atari computers in the early 80s. However, what I like is the numeric keyboard.<br />The screen is bright and OK to view movies. Beware, there is a tiny button to eject the DVD tray, so small that it is almost impossible to see it. To make it more convenient, I stuck a small white mark on it, and now it's okay.<br />Overall, this laptop is fast enough for most uses. And again for the price it is difficult to beat.",2015-08-31

I have been asked to test several of their tablets and everyone has been a very well built and nice tablet for the price..  Lets start with a simple breakdown<br /><br />1.) Display - Display is the lacking point on all tablets for this price point.. The display isn't bad by any means BUT it is lower resolution than you might be used to..  BUT with that being said, NeuTab has about the best display for a tablet in this price range.. The display is sharp (For the resolution), the display is very bright and the display has decent (Not the best) but decent viewing angles..  Overall I have always been impressed with NeuTab displays!<br /><br />2.) Performance - The tablet has 1 GB of ram and a Quad Core CPU which is plenty unless you plan to do a lot of multitasking.. 1 GB is plenty for games, basic multitasking, basic video editing, photo editing and more..  The quadcore CPU is also plenty for those task..  Gaming wise, I tested 10 of the top 10 downloaded games and all WORKED GREAT!!! I also tested basic video editing from my GoPro camera and then tested basic photo editing using google snapseed and both worked fine!!  I then tested a few basic 3d games such as GTA and it played great with no issues.. I am very happy with the performance of this tablet!!<br /><br />3.) Battery Life - This tablet has GREAT BATTERY life.. I can get a FULL day out of the battery on pretty heavy use.. I can get several hours out of the battery with gaming.. and with basic use I received almost 2 days of battery life!!  The 6,000mAH battery is a beast in this tablet..<br /><br />4.) Memory - Tablet has 16 GB built in which is plenty for apps.. I love watching movies on tablets like this though, so I would recommend a MICRO SD card if you plan on loading a lot of pictures or movies<br /><br />5.) Streaming Media - This tablet is GREAT for streaming..  Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video (and regular instant video), Hulu, Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora where all tested on this tablet and all worked GREAT!!  The screen is nice and big making this a great tablet for movies.. The built in speakers also worked very well!!<br /><br />6.) Bluetooth - This tablet offers bluetooth that worked great!  I paired it with several devices without any issues.. Bluetooth Speakers, headphones, keyboards all worked very nicely with this tablet..<br /><br />7.) Touchscreen - Worked very well and I had no issues with multitouch!<br /><br />8.) Speakers - The built in speakers are excellent!!<br /><br />9.) Ports - None of the ports, including the Micro SD card are hidden making it very easy to attach things, charge, and even change micro SD card!  This is a feature I love about NeuTab Tablets!<br /><br />10.) Camera - Camera works OK.. Not the best but neither are the cameras on Kindle Fire tablets.. For a tablet camera it is fine.. The tablet also has a front camera that worked great for SKYPE<br /><br />11.) Customer Service -  I have contacted the NeuTab support team a few times and they are all very friendly, and reply very quickly.. They are very easy to understand.<br /><br />Overall - a 10 inch tablet for under $100?? and a GREAT one at that!! What do you have to lose!  This tablet has a decent screen, full of features, and has an amazing battery!!  All for under $100!  It is a good tablet for gaming, children, beater tablet.. You name it, this is a decent tablet for it!!  I would recommend this to anyone..

I found this monitor used, which was actually factory-refurbished, for an awesome price of around $275. I was so impressed, I bought three of them (multi-monitor with a single PC). I originally chose this monitor because it has very low latency input, ideal for gaming enthusiasts. What's more, it has multiple-inputs (DVI dual-link or DisplayPort) AND it has video-scaling, allowing display of lower-resolutions in a pinch. (if your graphics is not powerful enough, you can reduce game resolution to 1920x1080) But what's most awesome is the stand. You can raise the height, tilt and swivel.<br /><br />Gamers will naturally compare it to those Korean non-name 27&#34; monitors everyone talks about for gaming (Qnix, etc.) This monitor is cheaper, (albeit used) has multiple-inputs with DPort, screen-scaling, an awesome stand, and very low latency input comparable to the very basic Qnix which has no scaler, one input and a crap stand.<br /><br />I was considering buying a Qnix, along with an Ergotron monitor stand, but after I found this monitor for less than the Qnix alone. Wow wow WOW, i'm super-stoked I found this awesome monitor!",2015-08-31

Most are 7-8 inch tablets.  I wasn't sure using a 10 inch tablet would be much more beneficial than a smaller tablet.  There are definitely some benefits to a larger tablet.<br /><br />This is an Android tablet that comes preloaded with Google Android 4.4.  This tablet has an octacore processor so it eally flies when using it.  Apps load quickly and so far I have not had any apps or videos freeze.  The tablet is extremely responsive to touch.  I usually only have to touch one time and it responds.  This is true for opening apps or typing.<br /><br />The tablet has a great picture on the screen.  I did some side by side comparisions to other tablets we have and I can't really tell a  huge difference in the quality of the pictures on the screen.  The colors on the screen are vibrant and the picture is very clear.  This tablet connects to our wifi quickly.  Internet pages load quickly and play well.  I don't have any trouble with videos on YouTube or Netflix sitting and spinning trying to load.<br /><br />The volume control on this tablet is different than most of the tablets we have.  There are no external controls.  I wasn't sure I would ike this but I now have a couple of tablets like this and I prefer it.  I am notorious for accidentially pushing buttons on the outside of tablets.  WIth this tablet, there are only two buttons on the outside.  One is the power button which also wakes up the tablet.  The other is an ESC (escape) button.  This is a really cool and fast way to quickly exit what you are doing.  There are three ports on the tablet.  There is a micro USB charging port and an audio port.  There is also a micro HDMI output port.  This port really changes what can be done with this tablet.  I can plug this tablet into my TV and watch movies from my tablet to my TV.  We have a TV in our house with no cable so now I can use this tablet to watch Netflix or Hulu on my TV.<br /><br />This is a larger tablet so it does weigh more than my smaller tablets.  For the size of the tablet, it is still really light weight.  It's a very thin tablet so I can still carry it around in my purse.  Overall, I am impressed with this tablet.  I am using it with a Bluetooth keyboard.  Together, these really give me a device that works like a small laptop.<br /><br />Product provided as a free promtional sample in exchange for my evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.eigh more than my smaller tablets.

(1) It is extremely light weight, with very good stereo sound. (2) The detachable microphone has a sturdy soft rubber casing that is segmented for flexibility. (3) This headset has allowed myself to get fully immersed into my games, enhancing my overall gaming performance in multiplayer PvP. (4) Comfortable to wear, you can almost forget you're wearing them. (5) For me, the length of the connecting cord from headset to controller is at an ideal length, not to long and not to short. (6) Comes with an extra micro-usb cord so you can recharge the headset without detaching the transceiver to do so.<br /><br />Con: (1.) The plastic chrome makes it look cheap. (2.) It is so light weight, it gives the illusion that's it is extremely fragile. (3.) When the headset is not &#34;On&#34; the LED on the transceiver flashes between red and blue.

The setup could be done easily by a novice.  It walks you through the process.  The best part is the speed.  I purchased a Western Digital EX2 Nas for storing my videos.  Using my previous router which is a Netgear N600 WNDR3400, the fastest the files would download was 11.1 MB/sec.  I was mad at how slow file transfer was.  I figured that maybe the router throughput speed might be the problem. So I went with this Gigabit router from ASUS.  I was blown away with the new transfer rate of 55 MB/sec.  I cannot believe that the Netgear was so slow. (That's 5X!)<br />The next big surprise was the wireless coverage.  My Netgear WNDR3400 would barely reach from my office to the family room. With the ASUS I am getting full signal strength.  It must be the 3 antennas that make the difference.<br />It is expensive, but I figure paying 80 more that some of the other $100 routers is money well spent.  I couldn't be happier.",2015-08-31

Also came with a nice pouch. However, the connection is a tad bit faulty. I ordered this adapter to connect our lab's Mac to our Optoma projector. The projector has a VGA cable connected to it, and this adapter in turn needs to be connected to this cable via the VGA-port-side, and then mini-DVI side goes into the port on our Mac. When I tried this for our lab meeting power point presentation, the slides projected just fine, however there was the &#34;blue-wash&#34; over the screen that occurs when the connections between display cables and ports are not completely flush. However, I made sure the DVI to MAC and the VGA to connecting cable were inserted as deeply and securely as possible, and yet the connection was still faulty. I had to bend the adapter cable 90 degree to the left and hold it in place with a heavy object for the projection to be completely clear. So it worked, finally, but only with some finagling. Unfortunately I have to bend it a little every time to get the projection to be clear, which isn't a terrible inconvenience but not worth 4 or 5 stars. (I am keeping in mind that the problem could be with the VGA cable to projector connection, however, this has always worked with no issues in the past with other connecting DVI to VGA Adapter cables, this new cable I ordered has been the only thing to bring about issues).",2015-08-31

Fails to hold the iPad securely, as many other reviews have noted. Now every time I use the touchscreen, the iPad falls out of the clips (you'll see what I mean in a few months of heavy use if you buy one). Makes it virtually useless, and embarrassing in meetings (as it will slap to the table, flattened, with a loud thud). Also, it appears to be scratching/marring the iPad screen, especially around the edges. Luckily this is a work device... if I paid for it myself, I'd be livid.<br /><br />Keyboard itself is great. Responsive, thin, and I type on it really well. A pleasure to use. Makes the fact that the overall design is flawed even more disappointing.<br /><br />Do not buy unless you don't mind replacing it in a few months, and keeping your screen free of scratches is not a priority. This is essentially an expensive, 3-6 month disposable keyboard cover that will actually damage your device.",2015-08-31

I have flashed the firmware multiple times, reset the router and troubleshooted the router and it keeps dropping the wireless and devices. So this is what I have experienced with the router.   This router is being used with many wireless and wires devices at the same time. 2 3DS, 2 Vitas, PS4,XBone, Wii U, 2 Laptops, 2 Desktops 2 phones, tablet and a Nexus Player. This router should be able to handle this load with out any issue but it is not. The PS4 and XBone will have a Open NAT one minute and the next it would be strict or moderate. A reset fixes this issue. The laptops would lose connection all together. A reset fixes this issues as well.   Now the 3DS and Vitas are strange. The routers WiFi would actually lock up both 3DS if they are in stand by mode and after you restart them the 3DS could not locate the SSID from the router. A reset fixes this issue for a short time. The Vita's well, the router just wont connect to them any more.   All of this slowly have gotten worse over time. I must of gotten a defective unit or just a horrible product.   I have test with my older backup router and all the devices connect to it and have no issues.  The issue is coming from the D-Link AC3200 I have reset this router more less than a year than I have my entire lifetime of routers.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Very easy to setup. If you use it for gaming do yourself a favor and do not use smart connect. With multiple devices it tends to have a small amount of latency when using it. Just setup the tri band with 3 different SSIDs  This will handle many many devices.",2015-08-31

Having fixed all the technical issues, my only complaint is the price (but all these NAS drives are way overpriced). If you need a good reliable RAID like system, this is the solution for you.  Real plug and play once you know what you are doing and their techies will walk you through iSCSI with a smile. CONS: When the DROBO warranty runs out, you are screwed.  Extending it will cost an unsupportable $250 or so PER YEAR.  A lot of the inner workings are &#34;proprietary&#34; and the techs won't share that.  So you are on the hook for a whole lotta money or like me, you are thinking about selling this thing online.  If Drobo opened up their tech department or went open code, I would be their friend for life.  As it is, it's a great solution for a year, then it's a high end doorstop.",2015-08-31

It does not support the Windows offline files feature.  Using Windows 7, the Offline availability indicates &#34;Not available&#34;.  I have used a succession of NAS drives for many years (Buffalo and Seagate).  None of my past NAS drives was perfect but all of these drives have supported windows &#34;offline files&#34; feature out of the box.  I find &#34;offline files&#34; indispensable for a NAS drive.  Not only does it allow easy backups, which you can control, but it allows multiple users to work on the same project in the field without accidentally overwriting each others work.  The Windows Offline files feature also allows multiple laptops to be set up to back each other up for hardware failure.  When your laptop gives you the blue screen of death or you drop it while working on a ladder, no problem, just hit sync on your backup machine and at least you are back where you started the day (or better if you synced remotely).  You can have different laptops or tablets for different tasks and keep them all synced and ready to go.  In my opinion a NAS drive is not complete without the Windows Offline Files feature.  This limitation should have been clearly stated in the product advertising and literature.",2015-08-31

I was using a Bus Pirate and it was taking about 25 minutes to reprogram each part.  With this each part programs in 2 minutes which is much better. The reason this only gets 3 stars is because the drivers included with it for 64bit windows aren't signed, this means you have to jump through a lot of hoops if you want to use this on a 64 bit machine.  I cheated since i have access to a real signing certificate through my work.  I had to modify the .inf file but eventually I was able to sign the drivers and get it working on my 64 bit Win 8.1 machine.  Update: Global Cyber Mart responded quickly to my request for signed 64 bit drivers and pointed out that the item says 32 bit.  So I've increased the rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I've suggested they add a bullet item stating specifically that it is NOT supported for win 7/8/8.1 64 bit because I think the way they indicated 32 bit only support wasn't very obvious.

It's worked well. out of the box.  Wanted to get Win 8.1 before they all come out with Win 10.<br /><br />My first ssd.  It would be fun to watch it work, if there was anything to see.  Pretty much instant everything.<br /><br />The backlit keyboard has excellent touch and huge letters.  Very easy to use.<br /><br />The HDMI port works fine with my Sony Bravia 32&#34; TV.  Picture is crisp.  Fonts are also crisp.<br /><br />There's a neat little charging feature through a USB3 port that lets it charge off the power cord or the battery even if the PC is hibernating, sleeping, or even shut down, I think.  Not sure if it works on all 4 USB 3 ports, but conceivable a person could get rid of a nest of charging cords.  It adjusts to the power needed for each attachment.<br /><br />The video card is such high resolution, the native resolution doesn't work for my TV-PC monitor.  However, it adjusted to the TV's resolution perfectly after a reboot.  And the card's ultra high resolution is a bit tiny for me to see on the laptop's native monitor.  I should have gotten progressive lenses in this last pair of eyeglasses.  Hasn't mattered to me.  I didn't buy it to manage photos.<br /><br />The included software is nice.  I never used that stuff off my HP PCs.  The movie manager was fun to set up with my video collection.  It even manages multiple-episode TV series collections.  I think one of the included programs will convert DVD videos to the hard drive.  DVDs are often much cheaper than the downloads, so I've bought quite a few.  I've been using WinDVD to rip and code.<br /><br />Can't find a YouTube downloader, but the free one online works fine.<br /><br />The almost terabyte ssd will be adequate for my needs.<br /><br />Update:  Has a couple fun power gimmicks.  SO much more cleverly designed than any HP I've had in years.  The power features have a &#34;Panel Open - Power On&#34; setting to avoid continually charging the battery if it's plugged in all the time, like mine is.  &#34;Panel Open - Power On&#34; is in the Control Panel power options.  Turn the setting on, unplug and use battery down to 50%.  Then plug back in.  It charges up to 80% and then runs straight through from the power cord instead of the battery.  Runs cooler, too.  I notice that over a few nights, the battery has drained down to 79%.  I'm assuming that the bit of battery drain eventually gets recharged.<br /><br />There's another setting where the speakers can be used with a line in, such as from a phone, even if it's powered off or sleeping or hibernating.  Maybe not more practical than earbuds, but fun.  Also the USB ports can be lowered to USB 2 to save battery.  Another thing it can do is charge phone, Kindle, etc., even if powered off or sleeping or hibernating.  These options can be run off battery or plugged in.  Neat ideas to play with.  What a great sense of humor those designers have.<br /><br />This PC has worked flawlessly for the couple weeks I've had it going at least 16 hours a day.",2015-08-31

It works with the one shown in the link, exactly as people describe.  You can get the grounding pole into the rectangular 'hole' just fine.  See the photo of the rounded/mickey mouse style adapter that has the 3-pole halfway in to show the feasibility.<br /><br />On this adapter with the 2 usb ports, however, that hole is further from the two prongs and the grounding pole does not reach.  There IS a blank cover that is in the perfect place and size on the other side of the prong slots, but it is covered off because the electronics for the usb ports are directly underneath it. Two photos included of this newer, rectangular adapter that shows it does not take 3-pole.<br /><br />Overall, incredibly disappointing, and you guys need to check your facts.  If you still believe it is possible, reply here and post a photo of this EXACT adapter with a 3-pole being utilized.<br /><br />Frustrated with Kensington for a poorly designed 'newer model' and with the claims it takes a 3-pole.

If your kids will be using your iPad, this may not be the case for you.<br /> - To incline the iPad, the front cover of the case folds back and tucks into a little holder on the back cover. It tends to slide out of the holder at times.<br /> - The volume buttons are a little awkward to access when in the incline position.<br /><br />In summary, this is a decent product, with just a couple of small design flaws.

The GT-730 is perfect. It is inexpensive, low-power, and uses the latest 28nm process, although it only has one dual-link port, and no DisplayPort, so it's only good for one monitor with more than 1920 resolution.<br /><br />MSI is a good brand, and their cards usually use high-quality low-noise components. I was disappointed to find that this card is super-noisy. Because it is a half-height card, it has a very small fan, which will obviously be louder than a 90mm fan you'd find on a full-height card, but I found it to be unacceptably loud, even in 2D desktop mode. I used the MSI utility to adjust the fan-speed curve, but I found that on the desktop, it was already close to its minimum speed, at which it put out more noise than my CPU and case-fans combined.<br /><br />If you want the better GT-730 with GDDR5 memory, you'll be surprised to find that most manufacturers use this half-height format, which is bad if you prefer a quiet-PC. There is only ONE card that has a full-height format, the Gigabyte GV-N730D5-2GI, but at $80, it's somewhat more expensive than the others.<br /><br />What to do? Go fanless. If you can settle for the DDR3 memory, Zotac (and a few others) make a totally fanless card at around $55. I ordered that instead. It is perfect for desktop graphics, but obviously not for games. (I ran Team Fortress 2 (TF2) at 1280x960 resolution fine, but it's not powerful enough for anything more than that) -- I note that Adobe Photoshop can use CUDA cores for image rendering, so the GT-730's 384 CUDA cores makes it awesome for Photo-editing, and also video transcoding.",2015-08-31

This is my 5th, and last, Toshiba. I bought this laptop specifically because the specs say the memory is upgradeable to 16g, which I wanted to do to improve the speed of video editing.  What Toshiba is falling to tell customers is that the memory can only be upgraded by them, at an obscenely expensive cost...almost as much as the laptop.  All my other Toshiba's allowed me to upgrade my memory via a little access door on the bottom.  Not this one.  There's no way for the user to upgrade the memory, and Toshiba is intentionally misleading consumers by not stating this fact in the specs, or on the Amazon sale page.  Likewise with the hard drive.  If you want to change the HD to a SSD, or even have to re-seat the HD (which my older Toshiba has required more than once)  it's not possible.  This laptop is specifically designed to cost the user as much money as possible when it needs anything at all. Even the simplest of upgrades requires an expensive trip to Toshiba.  This laptop is so woefully deficient in memory that you can't even take a screenshot of a Facebook page when you have no other program open but your browser, and 55% of your memory available. (See photo)  Secondly, this laptop is physically dangerous in that the edge is so sharp it actually cuts your wrists when trying to type on it.  Perhaps Toshiba anticipated that customers would want to slit their wrists after waisting $700.00 on this cheaply made hunk of junk?  If so, this laptop is equipped to do the job.  Simply sliding your hand over to the numbers pad can draw blood....really.  Unfortunately, since it was not &#34;dead on arrival&#34; I can't send it back to Amazon, so I'm stuck with an over priced hunk of junk and the hope that there will be a class action suit regarding both the wrist slashing, and Toshiba's false and misleading claim that the memory is upgradeable.

I tried the stylus out on my tablet, and it pretty much works as advertised. I also tried it out on my smartphone, and that's where I knew this is a great product. The on-screen keyboard of my tablet is pretty big (relatively speaking) so I've always found it easy to type on (one of the big strengths of tablets). But when typing on my smartphone, I always have to deal with a LOT of typos because of my fingers, and invariably the wrong keys get hit, due to the smaller screen size and commensurately smaller size of the on-screen keys. But when I used this stylus, my typing accuracy was MUCH better than when using only my fingertips. So, in summary, a very nice pen reasonably priced.

They are poorly made and poorly serviced.  HP’s customer service knows nothing of either the customer or service.<br /><br />I have been awaiting shipment of my replacement Chromebook for over a month (details below).  Due to the complexity of my issue I was assigned a Customer Relations Case Manager (Vivian Hernandez, PPS CSS-A Customer Relations Case Manager).  Her co-worker, Paola Vanessa Picon was also included in all correspondence.<br /><br />The last I heard from either of these two ladies was on Aug 11th.  I was told that my Chromebook would ship on Aug 28th.  That day has come and gone.  Despite several follow up emails and voice messages I have not heard back.  Attempts to call several HP service numbers proved fruitless as the reps either could not access my case information or had non-functioning voice mail systems.<br /><br />So here’s my story...<br /><br />In November of 2014 I purchased an HP Chromebook 14. It had 4G of RAM and a 32G SDD. I was happy with it. While not as sleek as an Apple product, it met my needs.<br /><br />Around Feb or March of this year (2015) I noticed that some of the keys weren't working, specifically the I, J, U, T, and a few others. I installed all updates, and even power washed the unit, but no luck. I called HP, they agreed that the unit was defective and dispatched a box for return and repair.<br /><br />After about 2 weeks I received the unit back, but the keys STILL didn't work. Checking the paperwork it became clear that HP replaced the MOTHER board, not the KEY board.<br /><br />I called, complained and another box was dispatched. This repair took over three weeks due to some part shortage. I found this unacceptable, complained and my repair was expedited.<br /><br />I received my repaired unit in April, but noticed that Chrome would crash (He's Dead Jim) frequently. I put up with it for a while, but recently started to dig around. What I discovered is that I no longer have 4Gig of RAM, but 2 Gig and that my processes consume most of that.  When the motherboard was replaced it had the incorrect RAM size.<br /><br />After contacting HP yet again, and speaking to the above case manager, it was agreed that a new Chromebook was in order.  This was on July 28th.  Any and all attempts to determine when (or if) my new Chromebook will ship have been met with radio silence.  Emails are not answered and phone messages are not returned.  Collectively I’ve spent hours either on hold or  speaking to a rep.<br /><br />I’ve come to the conclusion that the replacement of my Chromebook was a lie, that HP felt that if they delayed the process long enough, I’d simply give up and go away.<br /><br />Purchase a product from this company if you feel you have no alternative, but do so knowing that in the event service is required (even under warranty) you’re basically on your own.<br /><br />You’ve been warned.scovered is that I no longer have 4Gig of RAM, but 2 Gig and that my processes consume most of that.

I transitioned from a Razer Deathradder 2013 and I play mainly CS:GO, and to a lesser extent Dota 2. The Deathadder is more naturally suited for a hybrid grip where part of your palm is touching the mouse but your fingers are also slightly lifted off. Didn't have a problem with that grip until I tried out the G303. It's definitely more aggressively claw oriented with a flatter and less form fitting design, but in my opinion this is perfect for a twitch shooter like counter strike since it give you more finger control (better and more precise than moving almost your whole hand). Compared to the g502, I liked the 303's more streamlined design and smoother buttons. With the g502, I felt like my thumb was always placed against a jagged edge / almost pressing down a side button. Not ideal for FPS where excess buttons are unnecessary and tracking/ergonomics is of utmost importance. This mouse is still great for genres outside FPS, but note that minimalist feature set/button count is definitely geared toward non-macro/hotkey intensive games like shooters. It would not be my first choice if Dota 2 were the main game I played, although it would work just fine.<br /><br />The sensor is flawless, I don't have anything to say about it because it just works perfectly as I expect it. Beware the surface tuning option: I found it to sometimes cause my mouse cursor to &#34;jump&#34; around (terrible mid fire fight in cs), and I have a glorious PC mousepad XL. The default setting works just as well (honestly can't notice a difference pre/post surface tuning) and I haven't encounter jumping issues since.<br /><br />The scroll wheel feels more solid with tighter, smaller &#34;notches&#34; than the deathadder, and clicking it is easy and responsive. The actual mouse buttons click as responsively as any of the top gaming mouses I've tried, including my deathadder (although I suspect the buttons on the DA have worn down adecent bit over time, so not a fair comparison)<br /><br />The LED design is pretty cool looking too.",2015-08-31

So I was skeptical about the capacity and convenience claims for this Think Tank Urban Approach 15 bag for mirrorless systems.  I purchased it, figuring I could always send it back if it proved oversold and inadequate.  But the bag is like some sort of magician's top hat:  once it is full, you could surprise an audience at a photography show by pulling one thing after another after yet another out of it.  I'm still amazed; and I'm the one who packed it.<br /><br />If, before I bought this compact bag, someone shown me the list of things I actually put into the bag, I would have thought he was grossly exaggerating.  And you may think that I am, too.  But it is remarkable how well designed the Urban Approach 15 is for a mirrorless system like the Olympus Micro Four-Thirds OM-D E-M1 and its M Zuiko lenses and accessories.  Believe it or not, here's the list of content of this bag (it does sound a bit like &#34;The 12 Days of Christmas&#34;) and they all fit in together at the same time:<br /><br />CAMERA AND LENSES:<br />OM-D E-M1 body with Crumpler Industry Disgrace camera strap<br />M.Zuiko ED 8mm F1.8 Fisheye PRO<br />Olympus BCL-0980 Body-cap Lens for Micro Four Thirds - 9mm - F/8.0<br />M.Zuiko 25mm f1.8<br />M.Zuiko ED 60mm f2.8 Macro<br />M.Zuiko 75mm f1.8<br />M.Zuiko ED 7-14mm f2.8 PRO<br />M.Zuiko ED 12-40mm f2.8 PRO<br />M.Zuiko ED 40-150mm f2.8 PRO<br />M.Zuiko Digital 1.4x Teleconverter MC-14 for the 40-150mm telephoto-zoom<br />M.Zuiko ED 75-300mm f4.8-6.7 II<br /><br />ACCESSORIES:<br />Lens caps (stored on lenses) for all lenses that come equipped with them<br />Haze filters and polarizers for all lens that can take them (these are on lenses or in a wallet pouch)<br />Olympus HLD-7 Camera Grip for Olympus E-M1 with OM-D GS-5 Grip Strap<br />Olympus CABLE REMOTE USB RM-UC1<br />Lexar Professional USB 3.0 Dual-Slot Reader<br />Several SanDisk Flash Memory Cards in a carrying case<br />E-M1 USB computer cable<br />Two Olympus BCN-1 Battery Chargers for BLN-1 Battery and cords<br />Two SF Cable, 2 Prong Right Angle Plug Adapters (US and European)<br />Three extra BLN-1 batteries in a case<br />Manfrotto MTPIXI-B PIXI Mini Tripod<br />Three Manfrotto Quick Release Plates (200PL) and tripod adjustment Allen-wrench<br />Manfrotto 337 Hot Shoe Double Axis Bubble Level<br />Olympus FL-LM2 Shoe Flash<br />Olympus MAL-1 Macro Arm Light<br />Extra Olympus hot shoe covers<br />Think Tank rain cover<br />Lens cleaner and tissues<br /><br />Strapped to  the right side of the bag is a Manfrotto BeFree compact aluminum tripod (its length exactly matches the bag's height).<br /><br />Finally, a 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro slips very easily into this fully loaded back.  The bag has a separate compartment for this between the main equipment compartment and the shoulder straps.  There is still room for an iPad, but I don't have one.<br /><br />LIKELY QUESTIONS:<br />Is this bag jammed full, so that I can't easily close the zippers?  No, not at all:  the high-quality zippers move quite freely (they can be locked, too).<br />Is the bag carefully and tightly packed, making use of all available space?  Yes on both points.<br />Can I get things into and out of the bag easily or do I have to pry them out?  Yes, things move in and out very easily .<br />Can I get anything else into the bag?  Probably not -- a BB maybe.  A larger flash (like the Olympus FL-50R Wireless Flash) would be nice, but the law of physics forbid it.  Anyway, it can travel in the suitcase.<br />How are the shoulder straps?  These are padded and adjustable so as to be comfortable enough.  There's a sternum strap to keep the bag from shifting.  The plastic buckles seem well-designed and of durable material.  The hang-carry loop on the top of the bag is adequate, though it might have been a little broader.<br />Is the bag conspicuous?  No, not at all.  Without the tripod strapped to it, it looks like something that might carry a few items for a day-trip.  It doesn't scream &#34;Steal me, I'm a camera bag!&#34;<br /><br />Is the bag heavy?  Yes, it is but not terribly so -- although I won't want to lug it about all day.  The virtue is that the kit is all there in one package, if I need to take everything with me.  As I won't carry this around on hikes or in the street, a Think Tank TurnStyle 20 Convertible Sling Bag & Belt Pack  rounds out the kit, ready for the few things I might use on any given day.<br /><br />SHORTCOMINGS:<br />Does the Urban Approach 15 have any serious faults or drawbacks?  No matter what you get, you always want that one more thing.  The only shortcomings I see are minor.<br />The outside pockets would be far more useful if they were bellows pockets with velcro closures.<br />The zippered pocket is said to be useful for an iPhone, but it looks to tight and shallow to be of much use for that.  Perhaps it could hold business cards or something of little bulk.<br />The side pockets are of stretch material:  one pocket is supposed to hold a water bottle, but it would have to be a very narrow and sturdy cylinder of limited capacity to fit into that pocket and not be crushed; the other stretch pocket is to support one or two feet of the tripod that is secured by a strap above (the tripod strap itself is of very clever design with a hidden velcro patch so it won't fall off and get lost), but you wonder whether the stretch material will hold up over time the way a ripstop nylon pocket would.<br />The rain cover is well designed:  It folds up into its own an attached pouch for compactness and to shield things from moisture after the rain stops.  It would have been better designed if Think Tank had followed LowePro's example and permanently attached the rain cover inside a velcro-closed compartment at the bottom of the bag so it could be pulled out and wrapped around the bag and stored afterwards (of course, this would have entailed extra cost and higher price, but probably not a lot for the convenience of carriage and insurance against losing the cover).<br /><br />The shortcomings are minor and not at all vexing.  I don't want to end the review on a negative note -- so let me say that is is a superior bag, it is reasonably priced, and it is perhaps the most utilitarian bag I've ever own (out of many over the years).  Try it; you'll like it.  And if you don't, Think Tank has a generous return policy.  So what's the risk?t looks like something that might carry a few items for a day-trip.

I am retired but am still fairly technical. I have a computer science degree, worked as a systems engineer for a computer company, worked in R&D for a computer company, and managed systems and software development for two companies. I usually have no difficulty getting a new device installed and properly configured.<br /><br />It simply would not work for me with the supplied installation CD. I went on the Linksys web site and downloaded the latest firmware (build 6) but going to 192.168.1.1 didn't take me to the Range Extender set up; it took me to my wireless router set up. I went into the Control Panel into the Network and Sharing Center and clicked on See Full Map. The map itself does not show the Range Extender but below the map is listed the devices discovered that could not be placed on the map. There I found the RE4000W. By right-clicking on that icon, you get the option to View Device Webpage. Clicking on that, I was indeed brought to the set up screen for the Range Extender. For me, its ip address was 192.168.1.247. This allowed me to log in (username blank, password admin), install the latest firmware and change the device's password to something other than the default admin for security purposes.<br /><br />I then downloaded the latest product installation program from the Linksys web site and ran it to install/configure the Range Extender. Note that it did not connect the first time, but the installation screen lists a number of possible reasons. One of the reasons is that you don't want your installation device (a laptop in my case) too close to the Range Extender itself. I was about five feet away. When I moved into another room, I was able to get a successful installation.<br /><br />Now the challenge was where to located the Range Extender &#34;permanently&#34; in the home. My wireless router is located in our basement, and I purchased this Range Extender to help my laptop connectivity from my home office on the main level of the house. Prior to the Range Extender installation, if I used my laptop in the kitchen which is directly above the wireless router location in the basement, I got a five bar connection and speedtest.net showed a 24 mbps download speed (I pay for a 20 mbps connection). If I moved my laptop to my home office, I got a two bar connection and speedtest.net showed that my download speed dropped to 1.8 mbps. My hope was that the Range Extender would allow me to get 24 mbps download speed in the home office.<br /><br />My first thought was to place the Range Extender in the kitchen directly above the wireless router location. That gave the Range Extender a five bar connection at both 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz. However, the laptop in my office only showed a three bar connection the the Range Extender and the download speed was only 2.6 mbps. (Note that in this location the signal needed to go through six walls.) I then moved the Range Extender to the office and observed the reverse of the problem - a good connection from my laptop to the Range Extender and a poor connection from the Range Extender to the wireless router (no connectivity at 5.0 Ghz and two bars at 2.4 Ghz).<br /><br />I then changed the Range Extender location to be on a wall in the kitchen between the original location and the home office. It gave me connectivity at both 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz but the speed was almost the same: 2.8 mbps. (Note that in this location the signal needed to go through four walls.) My &#34;last&#34; spot to try was putting the Range Extender in the wall outlet on our kitchen island. This location has a direct line of sight from the laptop to the Range Extender and is just 30 feet away. Voila!!! The connection from the Range Extender to the wireless routerhas five bars at 2.4 Ghz and four bars at 5.0 Ghz, and the connection from the Range Extender to the laptop has a five bar connection and a download speed of 25 mbps - exactly what I had expected.<br /><br />I rate this Very Good, because it is able to achieve the performance objective for my situation. However, I can well imagine that other home configurations may not be so forgiving. If I take my laptop to our master bedroom on the second floor of the house, my download speed drops to 20 mbps. If take it to the second floor bedroom on the opposite side of the house, the download speed drops to 2.0 mbps. Clearly, its range is significantly affected by the number of walls through which the signal must pass as well as what is in those walls.has five bars at 2.4 Ghz and four bars at 5.0 Ghz, and the connection from the Range Extender to the laptop has a five bar connection and a download speed of 25 mbps - exactly what I had expected.<br /><br />I rate this Very Good, because it is able to achieve the performance objective for my situation.

I have used different Logitech trackball models over the last 10+ years, and was sad that the USB corded version of the model is more expensive than the wireless model.  The Logitech wireless unifying drivers to pair the USB receiver with the mouse/keyboard has been Windows primarily, so I wasn't sure devices owned by me, would be used for the same long life time, like the corded versions I've owned and used.  If you don't have access to a Windows machine to set these devices, it is just easier to steer clear of them.  It appears that Logitech is making progress on porting the setup software to other platforms, but it does not appear to be without risks.  So be aware.<br /><br />At first, the trackball feels a touch sluggish until it is used a few days, and then it either break-in, or your body calibrates itself to the touch and that sensation is gone. I have been using two of these, one at home, and one at work for a solid year, and I am very pleased with this version of the trackball.  I have owned at least 4 others over the years, but this is my favorite of the lot so far.  I'm on the same set of batteries!<br /><br />My wrist thank me everyday that I enjoy using computers with these devices.  I'm considering purchasing a couple as spares, because I'm not sure that they won't be phased out over some other input method in the future, that I won't lime as well.  I usually try and repair/replace switches in these instead of buying new ones, so I get better than average long life.<br /><br />I like the Logitech brand, and get reasonable satisfaction from using their products as long as my expectations are in check.",2015-08-30

What an awesome case for the price.  Here are the pro's and con's.<br /><br />Pros<br />- USB 3.0.  Usability is important.  When you want to charge your iPhone, a USB 2.0 plug often will not work.  Most people do not think of this.<br />- Memory Card Reader.  It's not just about digital cameras.  We use them like flash drives for printing and scanning and moving pictures, movies, games, etc around between computers.<br />- Decent amount of space.  It's not my extra large tower.  You're not getting in a 105mm radiator for a cpu cooler, but for standard builds, it's a nice amount of space and you can make it look good.<br />- Looks great!<br /><br />Cons<br />- Fans are LOUD.  I ended up buying new fans because the person I was building this for explicitly said that they want a silent computer.<br />- No space to upgrade for an interior water cooling system.<br />- Only 2 5.25 bays<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this case.  It's a great price for what you're getting.  Knowing your limits, budgets, and planning upgrades years down the road is important.  If you come to a logical conclusion that this case fulfils that spot on your spreadsheet, GET IT.",2015-08-30

I hang onto my technology as long as possible, if it is working for me.  The pros are 1) it is smaller in overall size and therefore lighter; 2) the &#34;light&#34; is internal and you no longer have an extra purchase for a light in a case and 3) the screen is a touch screen and there is no keyboard.  Some of the pros turn into cons for me.  1) The internal &#34;light&#34; acts more like a contrast mechanism and seems to cause more eye strain for me than the E-ink with the external light source; 2) The touch screen is annoying at times. When I want to wipe away a hair or piece of dirt that fell onto my screen, I accidentally turn the page; 3) a power adapter has to be purchased separately if you want to charge from an outlet.  This came with the purchase of the E-ink Kindle and luckily it works with this generation as well. 4) You have to now pay extra to get the Whispernet (free 3G) which I did not have to do with my original Kindle.

The item starts up very quickly and can handle multitasking very well. It runs quiet overall and runs cool from the bottom. I haven't had a hot lap yet with a 3 hour use of web browsing and photo editing. I installed windows 10 immediately upon starting up the laptop for the first time. Everything installed smooth and runs smooth. From my understanding this is not the lightest laptop nor the heaviest. But its still very comfortable to carry around and have on your lap. I will admit that the exterior laptop quality of material used is not the best or even close. The keyboard does have flex in it, and plastic comes to mind for everything but the hardware. However I understand that for this price range of $575.00, I was more interested in having the 8 GB ram, 1 TB of hard drive space using an Intel I7 processor. I use my laptop for home use and for when I go on vacation for photo upload use. So this review is for the average user. The screen resolution is not the best. However I am fine with it and I am not a screen pixel buff. The screen resolution is identical to my old 2007 acer laptop which I never thought had a bad picture. I hope this laptop will give me another 8 years of solid use. My old acer is still running strong with the original battery but it was time I upgraded to 8GB of Ram which my old one which had 2 GB of ram. Wow what a difference. So if you are looking for laptop that will handle just about every use not including heavy gameplay, I recommend this laptop. I was willing to give up build quality for hardware specs. So using the laptop the past week I am very happy with my purchase. I will just have to be very careful not ever drop the thing.",2015-08-30

I almost don't need a second monitor anymore now that I can fit so much on one screen!  The color quality and viewing angles are top notch on this monitor as well.  It has all the right inputs (VGA, DVI, HDMI) and comes with a DVI and HDMI cable.  I'm using this next to a Dell S2440L that is about a year old.  While aesthetically the Dell looks sleeker, the resolution of this monitor makes everything look super crisp and clear.  Out of the box I barely had to make any adjustments, the picture just looks great (I did turn down the brightness a bit).  It is a bit taxing on my Radeon R7 video card during gaming (keep in mind I also have a secondary 1080p monitor), but it still works.  It has a very thin bezel and a non-glossy screen, so it should work pretty well in a room with direct sunlight.  I think my Dell monitor does slightly better with blacks and dark colors that look slightly more washed out on the Acer, but I highly doubt I would notice if I didn't have the two next to each other.  The screen does tilt, but not a lot.  The base itself feels sturdy, not a lot of wobble when I bump my desk.",2015-08-30

Now make no mistake, I've owned Logitech mice and for years have enjoyed their quality because I have yet to have one die on me or to have gotten tired of using them. The reason I picked up this mouse was because I realized I didn't have any good mice that were chorded and I was tired of having to recharge my wireless ones. I had done my research and was on the verge of buying the Logitech Proteus Core or Razer's Deathadder Chroma but something was holding me back...<br /><br />I could not for the life of me figure out why Redragon had such an impressive line of gaming mice, so many buyers, and so many good reviews with prices at just a fraction of Logitech's and Razer's gaming mice costs. So I did what I don't normally do and took a chance. Needless to say I am more than blown away by the quality of this mouse. Both the quality of the build and software to this mouse is on par with that of my Logitech G700. It has a threaded cable, customized LED's, weight tuning, programmable buttons, and a grip material on the uniquely designed outer shell that feels awesome. And you could not find another mouse with ALL of these features anywhere else for that price point.<br /><br />Ultimately if your on a budget like I am, do not hesitate to buy from this brand. Just make sure to pick a model that fits your play and work style. Sure, the overall design may be a little overzealous, but I think it looks badass...lol",2015-08-30

I just connected one near the router, the other at the PC far away in the house and it worked.  No issues and nothing to do but test them out.<br />My TWC connection speeds according the dsl report's speedtest is good for 24Mb/s downlink and 2.2Mb/s uplink as referenced by a physical cable into the cable modem itself.<br />When I moved the same PC to the far end of the house through these devices I test at the IDENTICAL speed over multiple iterations.  These devices have a program that you can download from LEA called &#34;LEA Softplug&#34; that shows status of the adapters and the LAN speed.  Mine indicates 104Mb/s with a &#34;High Speed&#34; link between the adapters.  Inside the app there is a powerline rate tab that shows 104Mb/s reception and 54 Mb/s transmission which looks to be the max rate I have available on my powerlines with them.<br />The only negative is a small one, but since I often listen to Art Bell show on Shortwave, my Panasonic Shortwave receiver now has a perpetual &#34;motor boat&#34; pulse in the audio from these devices since I am on AC power.  I verified it by disconnecting them (both) and the sound was gone.  Overall it is a small price to pay as I can go DC with the radio but it may be important to some people.  It may be able to be filtered at the radio but I am not going to worry about it.<br />These are really good products and the handy AC plug on them does not waste the outlet.  These are not the fastest on the market but work fine for my needs however I am not streaming HD video.<br />Two weeks of solid performance so far with no need to reset or do anything else to use them.<br /><br />Update 7/11/2016:<br />It has been almost a year with these units and they are still going strong without any issues.  A few months back, I attempted to improve speeds by testing the fastest units from a competing brand, but to my surprise, in my house, they offered no improvement in speed at all over these LEA 200's.  I have to conclude that my wiring does not allow for the fastest speeds so I am sticking with these units if I want to expand the network.on the market but work fine for my needs however I am not streaming HD video.

I am rough on my tablets (I've been through three this year) and I got tired of spending a fortune on an item I'm probably going to drop, sit on, etc. I've had this tablet long enough now to know it's pro's and cons. First let me say I'm not into games so I have no idea how it is for that. What I do use it for it performs it's job admirably. I've noticed a lot of reviewers state that there is no GPS, but there is in fact a GPS sensor. It is a little strange the way you have to turn it on, but it is there. Navigation is one of the primary things I use the tablet for and by using downloadable maps it works great. I have other dedicated GPS receivers as well as smart phones but nothing beats having a nice sized screen. I also use the tablet to wirelessly control my DSLR and once again it does the job flawlessly. The bottom line is, if you want a tablet that does just about anything you may need to do and don't want to shell out the big bucks this tablet should do the trick for you.",2015-08-30

The quality, look, and feel overall have exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />What I like:<br />The quality of the leather is firm and strong - perfect for carrying heavy items and maintaining its structure.<br />The smell is genuine leather - love it.<br />The design - very attractive and unisex, yet secure. Nobody's getting into this thing without having to work and catch your attention lol.<br />The size - I can fit EVERYTHING into this bag. As a career woman, this huge. Nothing worse than toting 3-4 bags to work everyday on the bus or train during rush hour!<br /><br />Now for what I don't like:<br />I wasn't crazy about the dry film I had to wipe off with a moist rag once received. However, given the price and country of origin, I am understanding of the manufacturing process and didn't find this to be too much of a bother.<br />The leather was not preconditioned - if you want it to have a bit of sheen, you'll want to have the mink oil, etc., handy. I'm not fond of my leather looking dry.<br />The buckles and strap connections make me slightly nervous. However, the stitching, bolts, and reinforcements in the high stress areas do give me some comfort. Still, I probably wouldn't use this bag to carry anything ridiculously heavy on a daily basis. I will be carrying a lightweight laptop, iPad, and toiletry bag, and it seems to accommodate like a true champ.<br /><br />Overall, I adore this bag! It's exactly what I was looking for and looks as though I paid 5x the amount for it, especially after the conditioning. As a matter of fact, a bag I saw for around $450 wasn't nearly as cute. I plan to give this one a real go and will report back in a few months after a bit of wear and tear.",2015-08-30

A completely different modem/router has eliminated the issues, so I can say definitively that the cause of the problems was the SBG6580 (specifically its Wi-Fi connectivity).<br /><br />Some have posted that power levels from the ISP may be the cause of the problem, but this is only if the modem itself loses its connection.  Wired connectivity did not seem to be an issue, only Wi-Fi.  So, that solution does not apply to the particular issue I am talking about.<br /><br />Also, take note that the dual-band frequencies do not operate concurrently.  It is switchable, so you can either run the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz, but not both at the same time.<br /><br />I have had good experiences with other Arris/Motorola networking hardware, but this model was a huge disappointment.",2015-08-30

In one example I went from a 160G HD to 240G SSD, and this was done by pulling the original HD from the netbook and plugging it into the standalone box along with the inbound SSD, then pressing the button for 3-seconds to start. The box does come with a USB cable, but it is needed for the initial step. It is used for mounting one or both drives into the directory of a host computer, where one can view and use them just like any other USB drive.  As discussed by others, the new drive gets partitioned as the old one was, so I rounded up a command-line utility (DiskPart included in WindowsXP/7/etc) and extend the partition out. Note that this utility and others will not allow you to change a partition on a currently active boot drive. Therefore I wouldn't want to immediately install the new drive back into my one-slot machine. Instead the USB cable is used to mount the drive onto a bootable machine, possibly this machine with the old drive reinstalled, then extend the partition. Now we are finally ready to swap in the new larger drive permanently.  Can the USB cable be used to clone the old drive before taking it out? Yes, however two issues. First, is that if your machine's USB port is only 2.0, then its going to take awhile. For instance, I've got that 500G clone-over-2.0 job going right now that is calculated to last 9 hours. For comparison, doing this using the stand-alone configuration would be perhaps 30 minutes tops. The second issue is that this KingWin product did not come with any host application software for doing this over-USB maneuver. Instead I went and pulled a (free) cloning app off the internet. However this was actually necessary for still another reason.  Although the KingWin is great at upsizing drives, a very common need, it refuses to go the other direction. In my other example, I cloned a 500G drive over to a fresh 1T drive. Initially then, the 1T drive has the same 500G partition as the original. Now keep the 500G partition, and wipe/format the original 500G drive, and then try the clone back the reverse direction. The red light on the smaller target goes out and all four blue lights flash unendingly, which I guess (because documentation is minimal) means that we are not proceeding any further. Hence the need for (free) cloning software that can in fact yank a 500G partition off a 1T drive and send it over to a 500G drive. So long as neither the source drive nor the destination are the drive your machine has booted off of. Got it?",2015-08-30

People seem to complain about Windows 8.1, but I actually like it with a touchscreen computer. In short, here's my impression:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fast processor: the computer performs well when doing CPU-heavy tasks.<br />- Lovely screen: Photos and videos look really nice on this machine, the touchscreen is responsive and fun to use.<br />- Keyboard: I really like the feel of the keyboard, it has smooth press-action while feeling solid and precise.<br />- USB 3.0: The processor and USB3 ports make for fast file transfers to external drives.<br />- Size: I think the size and weight of this laptop are ideal for traveling. It's thin and light, making it very comfortable to use while out and about.<br />- Noise: Compared to my old laptop, this thing produces minimal noise. It doesn't get hot, therefor is comfortable to use on your lap.<br />- Fast start/shut down: This laptop turns on from being all the way shut off quickly, a huge improvement over my old Win7 laptop.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Touchpad: Something odd happens with the touchpad; even if I disable it, it comes back on. This makes typing annoying at times since if I accidentally swipe the pad it moves my cursor potentially messing with what I'm working on. There's no way to disable the driver for the touchpad either. I've tried everything! Other than that, it's a good touchpad, I'm simply irritated I can't turn it off.<br />- Power cord: The one it comes with is a bit shorter than I like, so I had to buy an extension.<br />- Battery: Depends on what your standards for battery life are, I get on average 4-5 hours out of a full charge if I'm doing a typical workload (1-2 browses open with many tabs, spreadsheets, iTunes, FileExplorer, Adobe software, etc). I suppose this really isn't that bad, but then again compared to a Mac this may not be enough for some people (i.e. 8-9 hours with a MacBook Pro, however it's twice the price).<br />- Shift key: Lastly, and perhaps a little nit-picky, the right shift key is smaller than the left one so it's taken some practice to not hit the wrong key.<br />-I have found NO WAY to disable the automatic screen dimming feature, it's driving me nuts. I've tried several different methods to turn it off, even editing the registry, but nothing worked.",2015-08-30

My previous laptop (an HP model) was beat up and on its last legs and I was excited to purchase the 2-1 at a great price and a new HP product.<br /><br />I received my computer a few dyas later and the keyboard didn't work at all but I knew I had the onscreen keyboard and that was fine. A few weeks after getting the computer I started having issues with the wireless connections. The wireless signal would drop and say &#34;no networks found&#34; whether I was at home using the wireless or at my place of work. Each location would normally show 6 or more networks, yet my new laptop couldn't read any. After using your horrid website for support, I finally found an 800 number to call. I explained the situation with the wireless and keyboard, I was sent a box, shipped it to HP and a week later the computer came back &#34;fixed&#34;.<br /><br />After a week or two, the same thing happened again...&#34;no networks found&#34; once again. The good news was the keyboard worked. Same routine, called, box, ship, repair, shipped back.<br /><br />A few days later I started having the same wireless issues. At this point, my feeling was the issue is unfixable and when at home I was able to reconnect by going into the control panel. However, calamity struck again as the computer would not turn on at all. I called HP support and explained that the wireless still wasn't fixed and now the computer would not even turn on. I told the outsourced support tech that the computer was a lemon and they needed to send me a new one as a replacement. He asked me where I purchased it from. I told him Amazon.com. He said they couldn't replace it because I didn't buy it from HP. Wait, WHAT? HP will not replace a defective computer that it built? HP will not stand behind its products because I didn't purchase it directly from them?<br /><br />Your outsourced tech just wanted to trouble shoot the problem, following hisscript instead of listening to the customer and, you know, actuallty trying to help me...I asked him several times to just send me the box so they can &#34;repair&#34; the computer. Finally he sends me to his &#34;supervisor&#34; who wants to trouble shoot....AGAIN. I told her several times to just send me the box, that I already did the trouble shoot with the other guy and it still wouldn't turn on...I repeated to her that the computer was a lemon and they should replace it but she said they wouldn't do that. The call dropped (My phone was the issue-no one on your outsourced end ended the call). This took place on Saturday, August 22nd. I received a voicemail on Wednesday, August 26 from HP support asking me if I still wanted the support ticket open and that they have tried to call me several times. If I was called, no message was left until Wednesday and I generally do not pick up the phone<br /> when I recieve calls from unfamilair numbers, so the effort to reach me was minimal at best and I should have been called back within minutes of the call disconnecting, not hours or days.<br /><br />Since HP wouldn't stand behind their product I contacted Amazon.com. My return window had long since passed but I explained the situation to their customer service rep and he placed me on hold to talk to his supervisor about a solution for me. The call dropped-again issues on my end. But guess what? He called me back within 5 minutes. He told me that Amazon.com would allow me to return the product and credit me back the cost of the defective computer and I could then purchase something of my choosing with the funds. Five minutes after that, I had an email with the return sticker so that I could ship your lemon computer back to Amazon.com.<br /><br />So, what have we learned? 1. Amazon.com cares about its customers and stands behind what it sells. 2. HP doesn't care about its customers and doesn't stand behind what it manufactures. 3. I won't be purchasing any more HP products.<br /><br />HP emailed me back and wants to talk to me about these issues. Of course they can only call me between 8am and 5pm PST Monday-Friday...which is when I work...and won't be taking their call. I told them if they really want to talk to me they can call me any week night after 6pm PST.<br /><br />A HUGE thank you to Amazon.com for helping me and standing behind the products they sell. A lesson all manufacturers and retailers should take note of. This is why I will continue to be a loyal amazon.com shopper.",2015-08-30

No customer support from NeuTab however","I purchased this model for $50 rather than the $120 that it originally retailed for. I think had the price been higher my review would be lower.  First off this is a very light tablet. I would be very concerned if I dropped it, the plastic case seems like it would shatter instantly upon impact. This can be a bonus as its small enough to fit in my back pocket without me noticing it, but on the other hand if I sat down with it still in my pocket I'm certain I'd break it. Just keep in mind that it is a very light (and presumably flimsy) tablet. This is exactly what you'd expect for a $50 tablet, however.  The screen does not perform well outdoors. Even at maximum brightness you can't see anything on the screen when outdoors. To me this is not a problem since it doesn't have any type of cell connection so I planned to use it almost exclusively indoors. Just make sure you don't have any sources of light shining directly on the screen.  The unit comes with a pretty good processor (for the price) but with only 512mb of RAM. This is the only truly negative factor with the tablet; you really have to make sure as few processes as possible are running in the background otherwise you will have some serious stability issues. A few apps crashed as I was downloading multiple updates. Had this been a more expensive tablet I might want to expect a little more.  As I said in the beginning its a pretty good tablet for the price. The one thing I would say is don't' expect to be able to play many games. A few games work but the low RAM will prevent several games from even booting up.  As far as the software itself, there is one issue that led me to return the tablet eventually. For some reason I was unable to update several Google apps on the tablet, including the &#34;Google App for Android&#34; app. This became a problem as the google search function was completely broken. I could search the web with Chrome but not with the Google App. Every time I attempted to update the app in the Google Play Store I received an error saying that the package was not properly signed and that I needed to uninstall and re-install the app. However, the Google App cannot be uninstalled on this device (this is not true on all Android devices and must presumably be particular to the install of Android 4.4 that NueTab puts on these tablets). I contacted NeuTab's customer support about this issue but received zero response. Had this been from a major manufacturer (Dell or Samsung, for example) I would probably give this fewer stars, but given the price I kind of expected as much. After much experimentation the only option left to me was to root the device and install a fresh version of Kitkat.  In the end I returned the tablet because if I'm going to be rooting a tablet I'd rather spend the same amount of money for a used tablet with higher system specifications, which I did.  In all, it was a decent tablet for the money, and I only returned the tablet for the reason above. Instead I ordered a used Dell Venue 7 tablet which has more storage and higher RAM (although sadly a slower processor) than this model, but is used.  If you're looking for a cheap tablet that will run email (although sadly not Google Inbox, for some reason) and web browsing, a few word processing applications and some games for $50 or less than I would recommend this tablet (presuming they fix the issue with the Google Search function). Just keep in mind that, due to its low price, you get what you pay for.",2015-08-30

Still Acclimating to Brightness.","I've been using this monitor for over two months now and I have to admit that it is worthy of five stars. So I've upgraded my original rating from 3 stars to 4 stars and now 5 stars - even though it is not perfect. The backlight intensity appears to drop off slightly at the edges most noticeably the outside inch or so. It may be because I'm sitting too close to the monitor and the viewing angle is affecting the apparent intensity at the edges.<br /><br />I was surprised that my 5 year old XFX ATI Radeon HD 5850 graphics card was able to display in full UHD resolution, but only at 24 frames per second. So I purchased a [[ASIN:B00OSS0AG4 EVGA GeForce GTX 970 FTW ACX 2.0 4GB GDDR5 256bit, DVI-I, DVI-D, HDMI, DP SLI Ready Graphics Card 04G-P4-2978-KR]] to drive this monitor. Now it displays at 60 frames per second at 4K after changing the display port setup to the latest standard, Version 1.2. Otherwise you will only get 30 frames per second.<br /><br />I absolutely hate the pivoting joystick control on the backside of this monitor. I think my rocker switch is partially defective because it seems to have a mind of its own.  It took nearly an hour just to set it to version 1.2.  Somehow the PIP got turned on and it was next to impossible to get rid of it.<br /><br />I had a 27&#34; HP monitor prior to this 40 inch monitor, so it took over a week for me to adapt to the blinding light from a 40 inch monitor when viewing text against a white background. I tried to lower the light intensity somewhat, but the contrast didn't look right. I could not sit in front of this monitor very long - gave me me a bad headache. But now I've adapted better - still get headaches if I don't take regular breaks. Or maybe I've gradually gone blind the past month. For the first two or three weeks I really regretted not getting a 32 inch UHD monitor, but now I'm at a point of no return. This monitor can partially light up a room at night when displaying a white background image. It produces a lot of light.<br /><br />Now that I've somewhat adapted to this monitor size, I find the 27 inch monitor feels small.  And the 23 inch monitor I have looks simply too small. It's surprising how quickly we adapt to bigger and better things. I bought a right angle power cord to push the monitor further away from where I sit. I think Philips should have supplied a right angle cord or at least have it connect toward the bottom like most monitors do. Philips includes a full range of useless cables for this monitor and omit the one most essential cable, the Display Port cable. I can't quite imagine why anyone would spend this much money on a monitor and not use the Display Port. Nearly all the other cables they included are useless and a total waste of money. And as I've already mentioned, the power cable should have been right angle so that it can be placed closer to the wall. So even the power cable is useless because I had to purchase it separately.<br /><br />My biggest concern is long term reliability. I have had very bad luck with Philips products in the past - three expensive home electronics items that all totally failed just after the warranty expired - a $2500 aggregate loss. If this monitor fails, it will be the last Philips product I ever purchase in my life.  If a monitor like this had been available from a name brand reputable supplier like LG or Samsung, I'd have purchased it even for a 25% adder in price.<br /><br />Now I can understand the advantage of a curved monitor. The light intensity drops off slightly as a function of the viewing angle if you are sitting close to the monitor. A curved monitor would help keep the viewing angle more perpendicular at the edges. I do a lot of accounting and comparisons, so it's advantageous to be able to do split screen. Sometimes I invert the screen color to avoid blinding myself and the resultant headaches.<br /><br />I bought a [[ASIN:B00U0UXYRQ Samsung BD-J7500 3D 4K Upscaling Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fi (2015 Model)]]to watch some movies using this monitor, but I haven't set up both the Blu-ray Player and the Philips Monitor yet.

I like the color and the material. The magnetic lock/unlock works as expected.<br /><br />However the ridge/hinge is significant. Maybe that's unavoidable.

A little work with a rat-tail file will address that. Second, the case rests too closely on the power switch which means that holding the case wrong can easily cause the power button to be activated, turning the iPad off at inopportune times.<br /><br />Again I think this is fixable using the file/rasp but I also think both of these issues could have been addressed in the product design or represent poor construction.",2015-08-30

But since it got here, there was some issues that came up:<br /><br />1. PC delivery was late. At least 2 weeks late. When we called Amazon to check on the status, Amazon decided that they would just send a replacement and call the previous a loss. Strange.<br /><br />2: The machine RESTARTS periodically. What do I mean by that? As soon I got the PC I installed StarCraft 2, League of Legends and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The machine handles League of Legends just fine. But when I started playing either Deus Ex or SC2, the PC would restart without warning. It happened a several times, enough for me to chat with Acer reps but they blamed it all on the system requirements of the games. I told them the PC surpasses the requirements and they did nothing else to help. To this day, I haven't played Deus Ex. Some owners of this PC blames it on the PSU saying Acer could've supplied a higher Watt PSU but thats all I can say about that.<br /><br />Other than that, I would give this PC a 4/5 since its a lot better than my old laptop. I would recommended skipping this PC altogether (even though the price tag is nice) and save up for another $500-1000 machine.",2015-08-30

Now the laptop does have cool sense in it and extra fans it still gets pretty warm sitting on our laps. I got the chance to review and test this thing so I wanted to give it a try. I had purchased a laptop fan when I got the laptop..I cheaped out and got one that didnt last a week.  I have been using this one well over a week now and its working great. There are 2 fans on there that have fairly large sized blades that move a lot of air. It is pretty quite too. The blue leds are cool but don't need to be there. It does add a cool factor to it though but cannot be turned off.  The cord wraps up nice on the bottom too when you are not using it. That is something my other one didnt have either. Plus on the end of the plug in it has another USB port..so you don't lose a USB port when you plug this in. Nice!<br /><br />All in all this has been doing great so far. It is lightweight plastic and the fan motors are pretty small but it does move some air around with the large blades. So I am giving this Kootek® Laptop Cooler Cooling Pad Fan a 5 star review and if anything changes in the course of my use I will change my review to reflect that.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

Basically, the higher the class of card, the faster the SD card saves the file (anywhere from 20 MB/second to 95 MB/second). This is important if you want to take advantage of advanced camera functions such as fast action shots, continuous burst mode and multiple frames per second, and HD video (1080p). Photos are written to your card almost instantly at the higher classes so you'll get your best shot, and you’ll save time moving it all from your camera to your computer. If you use these camera functions with a lower class SD card, you may lose data and experience dropouts and stuttering.<br /><br />ABOUT THIS SANDISK CLASS 10 SD CARD<br />This is a Class 10 SD card with write speeds of 48 MB/second. This card is great for compact-to-midrange point-and-shoot digital cameras and camcorders. I have used these cards in point and shoot cameras and game/trail cameras for the better part of a decade. I have also used some other brands. However, I've never had a SanDisk card malfunction like the other cards I've used have despite operating in below 0 degree to over 100 degrees conditions and running them through the washer/dryer. The manufacturer claims these cards are temperature proof, water proof, shock proof, and x-ray proof. These Class 10 cards are completely compatible with cameras, laptops, tablets, and other devices that support the SDHC and SDXC formats, and are capable of recording hours of HD video (1080p). These cards vary in their storage capacity (16, 32 and 64, and 128 GB).<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />The best thing about these cards is that they come with a lifetime limited warranty. However, I doubt that you'd ever use it. If you want quality, you can't go wrong with these SanDisk cards. I hope my review helps!",2015-08-30

I found the system info page that tells us what connection rate and a hole lot more You just refresh it to get an update, not as fancy as other router brands but it does show more than any GUI in other routers.  http://192.168.1.1/sysinfo.cgi  A little background, I had d-link, Netgear, apple, all were good except for Netgear had to reboot weekly to monthly, then RT-AC66R - this was a good Asus router, I had the RT-AC68R - this was good at 2.4GHz but 5GHz sucked in range so 5GHz usability was useless and it had awful USB support (problems).  Now the Asus RT-AC87R (I am going to reference it as 87r, I owned that for 1 year), where to begin….  I thought the 87r would be my router for years (boy was I wrong)…  The 5GHz covered all my house inside, BUT, areas where I put my phone, (to do wifi to hardwired device remote control) just gave me constant problems, some days after a new firmware it seemed to work (sometimes) and I thought finally, then some day or days later BAM not working in those areas again. (Now before you think or say something, all I did was change to the Linksys router, NOTHING ELSE, more on that below).  The best I ever achieved from the 87r was about maybe a month with a firmware, before something went wrong, lag, wifi drops, etc.. I totally gave up on USB drives connected through it, now I have a NAS (Best purchase I have made in years)  Onto my new Linksys EA8500, in my case, this is my first Linksys router I have ever owned.  First what I read on it….  - I read the web GUI was slow by some, I find it supper fast, I have no idea why others complain about that at all.  - Wifi range, well the Linksys is the same as the 87R with 2.4 GHz range (outstanding), and noticeably better than the 87r on the 5GHz band.  - I read of a few having some kind of power down after 6 hours or so, I havenever seen this at all (the latest firmware update address this anyway for the ones with tis issue).  Now my findings  Good  -Absolutely no dead wifi spots with the Linksys, super fast connection from my wifi app to wired lan control device.  I can't find any WiFi dead spots in my house with this Linksys router on 5 GHz or 2.4GHz. (As I have had with the 87r, especially with my remote app)  - I have an app on my phone that connects to a hardwired device, on the 87r this was so bad and useless that the original (old) app no longer functioned and I had to buy a different app to get it to work, I no longer have my phone wifi to hardwired device control problems at all, both apps work great on the Linksys EA8500 and I checked for the latest update on the first app that went wonky on the 87r and it was not updated for 30+ days.  - I no longer have any lag (tho dd-wrt firmware on the 87r removed it usually all the time, but it came back after days on the 87r).  My online gaming with Asus routers on Monday night’s were all horrible, so bad that I usually shut down my PS4.  Now with the EA8500 my lag is very minimal.  - Setup was simple, but I did do some reading into this before hand, so I knew what to tweak to get great performance out of the Linksys.  - I did have a HP wifi printer problem, FIXED I had to reset my network settings in my HP printer (nothing with the router at all).  - My download speeds since I installed the EA8500 are my best ever.  Any router before (including the rt-ac87r) I got a max of 30-32 down, now with the Linksys I always see 34-35.  -I have adjusted some things in the settings and unlike the 87r, no firmware degradation at all...... Meaning every time I rebooted (I owned 2 87r’s, first one died due to overheating) the 87r would perform worse and worse (more problems, etc..)after every reboot, no matter what firmware I used, until I flushed the ac87r and started from scratch again, it happened with both 87r’s, I have complained about thisfrom time to time with Asus and they did not care.  Nothing at all like this on the Linksys, the Linksys just works like it should and rebooting does nothing bad at all to it.  - NO WiFi drops with the Linksys on either band, the Linksys just works and works perfectly.  - Web page refreshes on wifi devices are the same as my Asus 87r (when it was working good)  - I use and love the way QOS is used on the linksys (I hated the Asus way, tried it, never worked for me and turned it off).  I see no speed degrade with QOS on, my ps4 also has very little lag, that's my priority in the QOS for me, so QOS in this router works.  - Linksys support is very great and responsive (from the printer issue I had, they gave me things to try on my Printer problem that turned out to be resettings network settings on the printer).  - DHCP reservation is super easy on the Linksys, you click on “Network Map” and all of your connected devices are showing, just click a device and add DHCP reservation, it’s that easy.  Linksys and I also recommends you do this, as some devices get confused (on any router)  Bad (if you call it bad)  - The IOS app to configure the router does not work with IOS 9 beta yet, expected as it is a beta IOS, it does work from my android note 10.1 version 1 perfectly. (I use the web GUI anyway, but I don't have to go into that often at all due to the Linksys just working).  - I have no idea what my wifi connections are at ( meaning 100, 300, 400, or 800), Asus and dd-wrt gave me this info, nowhere found on the Linksys. (This would be my only wish, but not needed)  - I don’t have lights up front and I like that, I do have a Linksys light on top that is steady when connected to my ISP and flashing when not, I do like this.  - I do not like the fact I only get 90 days telephone support, but with quick e-mail and forum support, it’s not needed.  - Pricy but performance and stability is worth the price (I paid more for my Asus rt-ac87r a year before and that was nothing but problems and stuff not working the entire year, yah it has more bells and whistles but at slower speeds and very unstable hardware and firmware)  Summery I don't have absolutely nothing bad to say or found about this router, I keep looking for something, not performing properly, but everything I do with the Linksys = it just works perfectly, to date.  If you are looking for tons of things to tweak, bloatware (I call it, you may not), love to reboot and have unstable hardware = look elsewhere, BUT if you are looking for a router with all the features needed and for a router that is stable as a rock = Look no further this EA8500 is the one!  So far I love this Linksys Router  If this stays like this, I have the best router made to date! This is how a router should work, perfectly. NOT half baked!!",2015-08-30

My order was placed at a particularly busy time in my business cycle and so I did not rush to install the software. I activated it, decided that the instructions were not clearly written and that I did not have time to work on it just then.<br /><br />When I did try to work through the backup process, I found that the buttons on the main work screen popup are all below the bottom of my laptop display. There is no scroll bar on the right side and the software is unusable. So I wrote to NovaStor's support people.<br /><br />The first email I received from NovaStor support had no relationship at all to the problem at hand – nothing at all. Even better, though, I received a &#34;case closed how did we do?&#34; email survey before I received the whacky support letter.<br /><br />I replied to NovaStor support and also to the survey saying that my problem was not solved. When the reply came, the technician said that there is no way to use the software without resizing the laptop display. That's it. Think about rebooting 4 times a day to do 2 backups.<br /><br />I applied for a refund for this unusable software but my request was denied because it had been over 30 days since my purchase. The Customer Service Dude was rude because I dared to ask for a refund outside of the warranty period.<br /><br />Why waste your time with an arrogant company that can't produce a usable interface?<br /><br />2015 Update.<br /><br />My computer crashed and when I tried to reinstall Novastor, I found that the serial number was &#34;disabled&#34;. I contacted Novastor to get a new serial number password or other workaround. The customer service department is rude and uninformed, wasting weeks of my time before sending me to another department that told me I had to buy a completely new installation.",2015-08-30

Great build quality, adjustable, sound, and mic. I will list all the details below.<br /><br />If I had to pack all the most important details into a few sentences and quotes, here are my best impressions.<br /><br />50mm sound driver - TOP quality. 50mm drivers are used in HiFi headphones, and popular name brands like Skullcandy and Beats.<br /><br />Great Build Quality: The headphones are big! The headband is 3 of my fingers across, but heavily padded. The ears are extremely cushioned along with the top, and a cool feature is \\""break - resistance\\"". In my words, that is what refers to the fact that the headband can bend back and forth, so if you stick this in a bag and have to putt it out, there is a better chance it will not break.<br /><br />Microphone quality: Video!<br /><br />The only complaints I had were that the microphone is positioned a bit farther away from your head than others, and that you can not use this for inline calls on a obile device like you can with many other headsets. Small issues though, so this product gets 5 stars! Please hit that little thumbs up if you liked my review!",2015-08-30

Apart from that, I was also missing the two fans on the left hand pane when the computer arrived. I have spoken to Cybertron about this issue, and their tech support staff member DJ was extremely helpful with the process of getting me the fans, and talking me through the options of new graphics cards.

This outcome did not please me.  I'm sure Asus makes a good product but this unit (refurbished) has some issues.

Basically, the higher the class of card, the faster the SD card saves the file (anywhere from 20 MB/second to 95 MB/second). This is important if you want to take advantage of advanced camera functions such as fast action shots, continuous burst mode and multiple frames per second, and HD video (1080p). Photos are written to your card almost instantly at the higher classes so you'll get your best shot, and you’ll save time moving it all from your camera to your computer. If you use these camera functions with a lower class SD card, you may lose data and experience dropouts and stuttering.<br /><br />ABOUT THIS SANDISK CLASS 4 SD CARDS<br />This is a standard Class 4 SD card with write speeds of 20 MB/second. Unless you take advantage of high end camera functions, you won't need a higher class (i.e. more expensive) card. I have used these cards in point and shoot cameras and game/trail cameras for the better part of a decade. I have also used some other brands. However, I've never had a SanDisk card malfunction like the other cards I've used have despite operating in below 0 degree to over 100 degrees conditions (rated to operate in conditions between -13 and 185 degrees) and running them through the washer/dryer. These standard Class 4 cards are completely compatible with cameras, laptops, tablets, and other devices that support the SDHC and SDXC formats, and are capable of recording hours of HD video (720p). These cards vary in their storage capacity (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 GB).<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />The best thing about these cards is that they come with a 5-year warranty. However, I doubt that you'd ever use it. If you want quality, you can't go wrong with these SanDisk cards. I hope my review helps!",2015-08-30

This keyboard is one of those items.  I have several Bluetooth keyboards but this one is different.  This keyboard really has everything that I have been looking for in a keyboard.<br /><br />This keyboard is a little over 10 inches wide.  I have a 10 inch tablet that sits on it perfectly.  The tablet is very thin and light weight.  This is really nice whn I take it with me.  The keyboard is Bluetooth and I had no trouble getting it to connect to my tablets.  When I pressed the connect button on the keyboard and pair on my tablet, a popup on the tablet asked me to enter a code on the tablet screen.  As soon as I entered the code, the tablet started working.<br /><br />The keyboard is very responsive to touch.  There is no lag time when pressing keys.  With this keyboard, I can type quickly without making a lot of mistakes.  There are two features of this keyboard that I really love and that really sold me on this keyboard.  First, there are two small legs/props that can be hidden inside the keyboard but pop out to use as a prop for the tablet.  My 10 inch tablet sets here very securely but my 7 inch also fits.  When using the keyboard with a tablet, it's like having a small laptop.  The second thing I really love about this keyboard, is the touchpad.  It works great and let's me use the keyboard to move around the screen instead of having to use a separate mouse or touching the screen.  I am used to using a laptop a lot so I use a touchpad all the time.  It is smaller than a standard keyboard but it feels very comfortable with the touchpad and the way the keys feel.<br /><br />There are a lot of extra &#34;functions&#34; on the this keyboard.  There is an option to turn off the touchpad.  There is also a Function num lock so that you can actually create a number keypad with some of the letter keys.  This is nice if you just need the the numbers so that they are in the same order as a regular number keypad.  You can use the keyboard to control volume, to pause and play music or videos, etc...  The keybaord really offers a ot of the same things that a full size keyboard would offer.<br /><br />So far I am happy with this keyboard.  It has worked with well each tablet I have tried it with.  The battery life of this keyboard is very impressive.  It will stay charged for 24-30 hours when being used.  I don't use it for that many straight hours so the keyboard lasts for days and days.  This is definitely an A+ item.<br /><br />Product purchased at a reduced price in exchange for my evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.re in the same order as a regular number keypad.

The price is very good for the performance. However, some huge downsides:<br />-Comes with a s***ton of bloatware from Acer. It took me at least an hour to figure out what to throw away and what to keep. What could I delete without gimping the computer? It's not very clear.<br />-However, I found out the bloatware runs even deeper. Need to upgrade your Intel Drivers? Gotta use the Acer drivers! Drivers which many games don't seem to recognize.<br />-RAM upgradability. You can't upgrade your RAM without a technician apparently. This is a problem for me; I live in Japan so I can't exactly go to Walmart.<br />-Hard disk upgradability. The s***ty hard disk read speeds are the biggest problem with this laptop. I thought I could simply switch out the hard drive for a better one, but this is quite annoying as they don't provide the laptop with a backup OEM Windows CD.<br /><br />The hard disk upgradability is a major concern for me especially because, just a few weeks after using this laptop, I get some random periodic slowdowns. Every 10 minutes or so, there's a 1 second program freeze (including games of course); my guess would be that its trying to access the hard drive but cannot go quickly enough, but it might be some of their integrated bloatware too. r<br /><br />It was pretty hard to find information about any of this. Most websites only review performance (which this laptop is not halfway bad at). But Acer are being dicks with bloatware. It's a real shame in light of things like the amazing quality screen, good performance and good price.",2015-08-30

We won't be able to get it turned back on until we delete something. There are a lot of pre installed items that we have no interest in, but cannot take them out.  It is easy for the child to use (but it is a pain in the neck when I am constantly having to switch accounts to add items to his account).<br /><br />I wish I would have saved the money and just bought another regular kindle, with the child protected case.

It works.  It's simple.  It's solid.","I'm quickly becoming a very bit TP-Link fan.  When balancing cost and quality, I've found their equipment to be really good.  Not perfect - but good enough and quickly getting better.  For this purchase I need a fairly basic router with simple software that just about anyone could configure.  It needed to be a solid performer that &#34;just worked&#34;.  So far, it's been running like a champ.<br /><br />Previously I'd had a D-Link that was about 4-5 years old in it's place.  That router did an admirable job but it didn't quite have the &#34;umpf!&#34; to push out that signal as far as I needed it to.  It had all internal antennas, so with this new purchase I knew I wanted something external.  This model has 3 external antennas and the signal strength is very good.<br /><br />I plugged it in and it started working immediately.  One critical point I have is that when it turns on, it doesn't have your standard &#34;admin/admin&#34; username and password.  The instructions don't really point that out very clearly.  What I was able to do was use &#34;admin&#34; as a username and then, on the back of the router, you'll find a series of numbers that represents the default pin for that device.  Type those numbers in as the password and you're good to go to configure it.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a solid performer.  Hasn't missed a beat since it was set up.  It's signal is strong enough now that I didn't need to use a WiFi extender I had plugged in halfway across the house.  That doesn't mean it's going to blast wifi everywhere you want it, but in my case and in the configuration for my home, it has worked wonderfully.",2015-08-30

The base is very pretty with the power symbol staying lit up.<br />- The led head has an aluminum top to dissipate heat although it does not get hot at all. I do wish the arm was metal but the plastic is very sturdy.<br />- At an extreme angle, the light does topple but no one would use it with the arm extended out so far.

Those screws that you see are not screws. It is just a cheap plastic trick to make you think you have a quality product. Those screws are not actually screws.

I ended up getting the warranty anyway ($25) and didn't know if we wanted a FreeTime subscription, so with my existing Prime membership and a free one-month trial we would only save $8 by buying the kids version IF we decide to keep the FreeTime subscription for a year.  We also didn't get the foam &#34;buffer&#34; with the non-kids version but I don't feel it's necessary.

FreeTime allows her access to books (which she loves), kids-specific apps which she can add and delete at will, and generally let's her have a tab customized just for her.  She's used to using other cheap (sub-$100) tablets, an iPod, and the PC so this thing is extremely user-friendly for her.  The ability to set late-evening/early-morning and time restrictions, allowing her &#34;game time&#34; only after earning credits, and all of the user-restrictions are very well thought out.<br /><br />Battery-life, display quality, and pretty much everything else about this tab is more than perfect.  Especially for it's price-range.<br /><br />What I don't like are the adds on the home screen (it's tacky and reminds me that this is Amazon's world - we only live in it) which you can pay an extra $16 (I believe) to have removed.  Again, this tablet doesn't suit me (or probably my pre-teen) who prefers the freedom ofa stock OS but for young kids or people who prefer their OS more &#34;user-friendly&#34; but locked down and catered to their needs (e.g. Apple users or grandparents) then this tab is perfect.<br /><br />TL;DR - Great for kids and less tech-savvy users, to restrictive for more advanced users.  Great quality product especially for the price.",2015-08-30

The mouse wheel was hard to click, the receiver sometimes needed to be disconnected and reconnected, and the rubber on the thumb rest started coming off.  Once I wore out the switch under the left-click button, it was time to upgrade.  This mouse does not look so ergonomic, but it falls naturally into the palm and works even better than the mouse it replaced.  The blue start menu button will not see much use, but the back button is beneath it and for now, is a little unfamiliar to work with.  It is, however, protected beneath the rubber and takes a small effort to push, whereas the fore/back buttons on the old mouse protruded a little too much and I was accidentally hitting them with my hand.<br /><br />I am now tempted to get the matching Sculpt keyboard, as it seems to be the only remaining split ergonomic wireless keyboard Microsoft offers.

Once my 13&#34; Macbook Pro is placed in this bag, there's maybe room for another notebook or small textbook.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's ok. You should recognize you're getting only $50 or so of leather bag...which is not a lot of leather bag. The hardware, leather, etc is all noticeably cheap, and it's very easy to spot the cut corners. The leather is quite stiff for how thin it is, possibly because of the lining. The look of the bag isn't too bad, though, so if you're looking for a cheap, decent looking bag that won't last too long or carry much at all, this may be worth it to you.<br /><br />Part of me thinks this deserves 4 stars for a product that roughly meets expectation for the price point, but I do want to emphasize that this isn't a high-quality product.

So I decided to take the risk and give it a shot and boy I'm glad I did my CPU now runs about 50% cooler than before and it doesn't shut down when trying to compress videos or gaming that was one of my biggest issues but now it's faster and it doesn't overheat at all.

The good: sturdy construction, good layout and responsive keys, strong magnet that holds the iPad steady when typing, connects easily with the iPad, strong holders provided to retain the iPad, nice faux leather and grey felt on the inside and cover shuts off the iPad screen when closed.  The keyboard is responsive and keys have good tension feedback by supportive springs.  For the short duration I tried the keyboard folio, I had no battery problem. The unit worked right out of the box and charged without issue.  The bad: works in only one position--desktop landscape with no angle adjustments and no portrait position use. In folio closed position there is no magnet holder or snaps or anything else that will hold the folio closed, which could be resolved by adding strong magnets outside of the iPad holder brackets. Like the IOS software keyboard no escape key is provided-function key and home key combo may be an option (I forgot to try it).  Cover captures fingerprints easily, but cleans easily. The keyboard keys cannot operate quietly.<br /><br />Had it not been for the one position operation mode provided, I would have overlook all other points listed as bad.

Unfortunately, it also has a defective DHCP reservation system that renders the router useless if DHCP reservations are enabled.<br /><br />Pros: This router has significantly better performance than the 7 year-old D-Link DIR-655 that it replaced.  It has better range but not to the degree that I could remove the additional access point on the opposite corner of my home.  The webpage interface and  the Android device interface app are both easy to use and reasonably comprehensive.<br />Cons: My biggest problem is that I had a 16-device DHCP reservation table on my DIR-655 that I could not reinstitute on the Archer C9, as doing so caused the DHCP process to become inoperable.  I had to settle for manually readdressing the devices that required a fixed hardwired IP address outside of the range of the dynamic DHCP address range.  I then let the computers on the LAN get dynamic addressing via DHCP.  When I want to locate their IP address, I have to go to the router's DHCP table.  I still have the potential problem of an address conflict among these computers if one has been asleep and finds that its address has been reassigned when waking.  This is a particular problem with laptops which might be carried around to different networks where that have to have dynamic addressing capability, and thus cannot be assigned a fixed address. I contacted TP-Link Support via email but have yet to hear back from them.  The router has the latest firmware (4.0.0 - 20150811).",2015-08-30

I got the keyboard and pen of course, and am a fan of OneNote, so the pen & tablet screen are important to me.  Don't get the RT, it's not a real computer.  I don't need a Pro (faster, bigger, heavier, fan, shorter battery life.)  I've had it for about a year now & it is my favorite computer & easily beats the heck out of any tablet.  (I think the new iPad finally has a good digitizer, but $$$ and at the end of the day, it's still not a computer. The small thin keyboard folds away or tears off easily which is important to encourage use as a tablet.  I don't go around writing glowing reviews for the heck of it, but this computer is great.

I play many online games like OSU!, MOBAs, MMOs (not much of a FPS fan) and stream a ton of anime. My PC is not that far from the router, I live in a one story house with my room located about maybe 13 yards away, so I can see if the signal strength can be an issue to some. I get around 50-60% signal strength daily. I have compared my Netgear N600 WNDA3100 dual band adapter to the TP-Link one and surprisingly enough, the TP-Link gave me a better speed and connection with about 2.4mb/s while the former gave me about 1.2mb/s on multiple tests throughout a couple weeks. Overall, this product was an amazing buy because a year ago I needed a cheap wireless adapter that could handle online play and stream anime all at once for my budget pc build and I am currently using it as I write this review, about a year later after purchase. I have used this adapter with Windows 8, 8.1, and 10!",2015-08-30

Works out of the box for Ubuntu 15.04","Solved my problem. New laptop, touchpad was interfering with typing. I bought an optical mouse at Microcenter. Made the mistake of buying a cheap mouse. I went there specifically thinking trackball but came back with a cheap optical mouse. Decided to go with this device because it's well rated. Ordered it. Received within a few days with standard shipping.<br /><br />Plugged it in using Ubuntu 15.04 no problem. I did not anticipate the adjustment required for drag and drop. I'm left handed. After switching the buttons I can click and hold my primary mouse button, drag and drop, no prob. I did spend some time looking for an app to provide click to drag because system mouse settings do not provide it. I found that switching the mouse buttons makes it easy to hold down the primary button and drag back and forth, up and down to my heart's content then release the button when I get to where I want to be.<br /><br />I actually like drag and drop with the trackball more than the mouse now that I've used it a bit because with a mouse you're still holding the mouse when you release the button which can incur additional unintended movement. With the trackball, once you lift your finger off the ball the cursor stays put.<br /><br />The scrollring is awesome. With a 13&#34; laptop there are concessions with the keyboard that required a function key to scroll with the keyboard. The cheap optical mouse had a scrollwheel which was tedious to use. The scrollring on the trackball is precise, zippy and easy to use.<br /><br />I was thinking I might be missing something with two buttons instead of three but a third button to paste doesn't matter. With my setup I can select text with the trackball, release my primary button, click again and drag to a new location while holding the button, release to paste text at the cursor location. Most likely drag and drop 101 but I'm very pleased.<br /><br />I decided on the wired trackball because any device, wireless or not, will occupy a usb port. My conclusion is, can't beat it for the money. Great value. Does everything I need it to straight out of the box. I hope my review saves someone else who may be moving over to a trackball some of the time I put into looking for click lock to drag solutions. You don't need 'em. Just configure the device so you can comfortably hold your primary button while articulating the ball.<br /><br />9/7/2015<br />Update. I bought my trackball used. After using it for awhile I noticed that it would sometimes catch inside its cradle causing the cursor to jump. The ball had a small scratch in the plastic. Using a fingernail emery board I smoothed it out then polished with metal polish. Now it's perfect.Great value. Does everything I need it to straight out of the box.

We did receive this keyboard at a reduced cost for out honest opinion/review, we were not compensated to get a positive review the thoughts here are my own.  This review is on the MGK1-K.  The difference in the MGK1 and the MGK1-K is that the color of the keyboard is now all black (the back is red on the MGK1), The palm rest that is included is now UV coated and they are using Brown switches in the MGK1-K instead of blue switches.  If you don't know the difference between blue switches and brown, the brown switches still give that satisfying \\""clack\\"" while typing but are not as loud as the blue switches.  There is a little difference in \\""Feel\\"" but not that much unless your a typing expert and in that case will already know which switches you like better (brown or blue).<br /><br />  Build quality on this keyboard is rock solid, now the keyboard itself is not that heavy weighing in at about 2.3 pounds once the palm rest is attached its is rock solid on your desk (even if you use the tabs in front to elevate the keyboard).  Nice brushed aluminum back plate under the keys make it great for the LED lighting to reflect off of.  The back lighting is a single color (white) that has 4 levels of brightness, the brightest not being overpowering.  Classy look, with out being too underwhelming.  You can also active \\""Reactive Mode\\"", which is where once you touch a key it will light up and then go out again a second later. The keyboard has a nice 6ft. thick braided USB cable that is also gold plated.<br /><br />  Button layout is spaced nicely with the keys having a nice concave feel to them.  There are your tradition \\""media\\"" shortcuts in the \\""F\\"" keys, you also get a ALT +F9 to lock the windows button on the keyboard so you do not hit it by accident.  The number pad is here of course and just above that is a mute button for your system sound.  Next to that there is a very cool and practical scroll wheel for your volume control, no more \\""ALT F key a bunch of times to change your volume.  Supporting Full USB NKRO on windows (Mac users can still get the 6 KRO).<br /><br />Overall this keyboard is a very pleasurable experience to type on, not just for gaming but for overall general use as well.  This is a great keyboard at a great price.  Azio has hit a home run with this keyboard.<br /><br />  Luke @ Galaxy Tech Reviewis a very cool and practical scroll wheel for your volume control, no more \\""ALT F key a bunch of times to change your volume.

Dell customer support were not helpful... basically just went through the usual checklist versus trying to determine the problem.  They ended up sending a technician to my house and replacing the motherboard.  It didn't resolve the issue, but we rolled back a Windows 8 update and one of the ports started working again, so we lived with it.  Now, 12 months + 21 days after purchase, the video GPU failed and we need another motherboard.  Of course, Dell won't cover the cost because it is past the original 12 months, despite the actual motherboard being only 8 months old.  I've been in IT for 22 years and have never seen a more error prone product.  Be warned - you may get lucky and have no problems... or you may be like me and waste $1500 on a computer that has a high failure rate and a bad company behind it.

Basically, the higher the class of card, the faster the SD card saves the file (anywhere from 20 MB/second to 95 MB/second). This is important if you want to take advantage of advanced camera functions such as fast action shots, continuous burst mode and multiple frames per second, and HD video (1080p). Photos are written to your card almost instantly at the higher classes so you'll get your best shot, and you’ll save time moving it all from your camera to your computer. If you use these camera functions with a lower class SD card, you may lose data and experience dropouts and stuttering.<br /><br />ABOUT THIS SANDISK CLASS 10 SD CARD<br />This is a Class 10 SD card with write speeds of 40 MB/second. This card is great for compact-to-midrange point-and-shoot digital cameras and camcorders. I have used these cards in point and shoot cameras and game/trail cameras for the better part of a decade. I have also used some other brands. However, I've never had a SanDisk card malfunction like the other cards I've used despite operating in below 0 degree to over 100 degrees conditions and running them through the washer/dryer. The manufacturer claims these cards are temperature proof, water proof, shock proof, and x-ray proof. These Class 10 cards are completely compatible with cameras, laptops, tablets, and other devices that support the SDHC and SDXC formats, and are capable of recording hours of HD video (1080p). These cards vary in their storage capacity (8, 16, 32 and 64, and 128 GB).<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />The best thing about these cards is that they come with a 10-year limited lifetime warranty. However, I doubt that you'd ever use it. If you want quality, you can't go wrong with these SanDisk cards. I hope my review helps!",2015-08-30

All of these people rating high must have gotten a different product than I did or mine was defective. I have over the years developed a preference for Netgear.  Every time I say to myself - &#34;that routers cheaper than the comparable Netgear one, lets just try it,&#34; I end up regretting it. My last Netgear Router I bought top of the line back in 2011. I am very happy with it. I figured this time I didn't really need top of the line, as the old router can handle it for the most part, I am just now running items that have the ac capability, but a router that doesn't. so I was looking for a few levels below top of the line, and figured I could save $50 over Netgear and go with this one. I have never tried TP Link before, but I figured the reviews seem to be okay.<br /><br />Well... that didn't happen. The 5ghz kept dropping out at random times (the whole reason I wanted a new router was for the ac and thats on the 5ghz freq.). I reset the router and it would come on, and a few hours later it would drop out again. Meanwhile the 2.4ghz network was working... but I certainly wasn't seeing the speeds of my old Netgear router. I run a lot on my networks and a lot of communication between devices, The only time I saw increases in speed over the old Netgear was when the 5ghz was working.  Then on day 3 both frequencies shut down. I dug through settings, thinking a Wake on LAN setting existed and wasn't set right (as I was using the network when it quit, this seemed unlikely). The layout was a little different than the Netgear I was used to and I was only learning the router so I kept thinking I was missing a setting somewhere. I work in IT, so I know routers, and computers, and I know often a setting somewhere can mess things up. I never found it. Meanwhile, the router started broadcasting SSID's that were not one's I created. I Suppose its possible that my neighbors bought a TP Link router at the same time I did (the SSID's all had TP Link in the name), and shut their router off when I shut my router off, but I find this unlikely. (My TP Link is off now and I am using my old Netgear again - no TP Link SSID's visible currently - I know its not full on scientific evidence, but its convincing enough for me that it was my router doing it. No I do not know why, never got the chance to investigate.)<br /><br />I noticed that the firmware version on the router was not up to date. &#34;Yay!&#34; I thought, &#34;a fix to my problems exists.&#34; So I matched up my router to the firmware and downloaded the newest version directly from TP Link's website. I loaded it up into the router. Let the router reset. That was the last time I was able to use the router. It came back on, it said based on indicator lights that it was broadcasting in both frequencies. And in fairness - I believe it was broadcasting a signal - but not for an SSID that I had created (Trying to connect to that one, it rejected my password, and the default password). Hooking direct to Ethernet to see what was going on, I got nothing. The router was shot. Thinking I had made a mistake, I double checked, nope, pretty sure that was the firmware I should have been using.<br /><br />In summary, I cannot recommend this device to anyone for anything except a paperweight. I really hope it was just defective, but my irritation with the router has led me to seek out a Netgear replacement, and I am sending the TP Link one back. $50 more is not worth this headache. I've never has issues with Netgear routers. I have been using them for years (in fairness, I have probably only owned like 3 Netgear routers because they last, but in between, I have owned, Linksys, Belkin, and now TP Link.) I would suggest you also spend the money, or ignore my warnings and try yourself.

I checked both of those and the internet connection was down on them to so I realized it wasn't an isolated problem.  I was able to get from my devices to the router, but not through it to my broadband cable modem.<br /><br />It wasnt my broadband connection because plugging my laptop directly to the modem worked.<br /><br />After hours on the phone with tech support, with reinstalling firmware, and countless reboots, we were never able to get it working again and even the Linksys tech support guy was running out of things to try.  Finally, it was determined this thing is just wacked.  It will connect intermittently but 5 seconds later, its down again.  Now I spend $230.00 at Target for this thing and luckily their return policy is good.  So I'm taking it right back to them tomorrow.<br /><br />I'm done with Linksys!

I have no issues whatsoever with the Space Bar key, as others have... Just press the key towards the middle, not on the edges (there's no actuator there)... The keys are very quiet, and I love the low profile of the keyboard... The texture is absolutely amazing; I love the smooth, rubberized finish... Note that the red strip on the bottom has a plastic cover when shipped. You need to remove that for it to look right. Adjusting the Speed of the breathing affect could be a little more precise; it seems there's a big jump between the medium and medium-high settings... but anyway, I seriously love this keyboard. I would just say to be careful with the risers on the back. I accidentally broke one of mine when picking my keyboard up; even though I barely touched it. I would say the two flip-out risers on the back are the worst part of the keyboard, but that's an easy MacGuyver fix.<br />-------------------------<br />EDIT:<br />Its been almost a year, and I now use this keyboard at work, as I love how quiet the keys are. I work for a tech support company where I type all day, every day.<br /><br />The second riser in the back broke about a week after the first one did. I was still using it, while I would put a sticky notepad under the other side, so that it was even, but it didn't matter. The quality of the riser is just crap, and they should be ashamed for putting something like that on a keyboard like this. It really brought down the value and over quality.<br /><br />The lighting effects are still very good, and none of the keys show any sign of degradation. Little bits of dust and crumbs, etc, will get stuck in the bezel around the dragon emblem. Due to the very low resistance/feedback of the keys, I found myself making quite a bit of typing mistakes, as sometimes one or two keys just wouldn't register while I was typing. Honestly, this was not the best gaming keyboard, as it really doesn't seem to have all that many gaming features.<br /><br />I have since bought this keyboard for gaming ([[ASIN:B01DD2SMKQ Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit Gaming Keyboards Computer Keyboard with Blue Switch, Water-Resistant for Gamers]]) and am about 500,000 times happier with it, although the Karura still works well after all this time.all that many gaming features.<br /><br />I have since bought this keyboard for gaming ([[ASIN:B01DD2SMKQ Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit Gaming Keyboards Computer Keyboard with Blue Switch, Water-Resistant for Gamers]]) and am about 500,000 times happier with it, although the Karura still works well after all this time.",2015-08-30

They are less than two months old. I can move the wire around to make it work but it is intermittent. This may be due to my son's habit of playing with the cord, wrapping around his fingers, etc. Or it may be due to poor design or quality. I'm not sure. If it failed because my son was playing with the cord then perhaps these won't work with us. We are headed on vacation in three weeks so I just ordered another pair of headphones.<br /><br />Remembering that our son used the Kidz Gear headset for years before they broke I'm switching back to Kidz Gear. When the Kidz Gear (two pair) broke it was the volume control in the cord that went bad. The new Kidz Gear headphones no longer have a volume control in the cord. I just ordered another Kidz Gear headset. (I later found out Kidz Gear still has a volume control, they just redesigned it.)<br /><br />Original Review<br />Good headphones for the price. The best thing I can say about these is my five-year-old likes them. They sound good, fit good, and I'm hoping the no tangle cord lives up to it's name.<br /><br />We had purchased two of the Kidz Gear headphones. The first pair lasted about two years, and the second about 18 months. That is pretty good service for a headset that is used often by a child, but... Both Kidz Gear headsets had to be tossed out due to the volume control in the cord which ceased to work. From what I can see Kidz Gear seems to have eliminated the volume control from their latest offering so they must have had too many complaints. However these Sentey were quite a bit less expensive so I thought we'd give them a try.",2015-08-30

I wouldn't risk it.<br /><br />After that, if you're like me, the experience should be pretty good for a while. The issue is that this thing's shoddy craftsmanship means it's prone to breaking. After about half a year of sitting at my desk, the screen suddenly stopped working. It would turn &#34;on&#34;, as according to the light in the corner, but the actual display was busted and I had to replace the whole thing. That's $90 in shipping, and YOU have to pay for it.<br /><br />Not even a week after receiving my replaced/refurbished tablet, it breaks again. This time, it doesn't detect the pen<br /><br />Huion's customer support is pretty decent - I've had a lot of experience with them at this point. They're willing to work with you and respond to emails, but that doesn't mean you aren't paying out of pocket once you get them to admit the product's defective.<br /><br />If you're like me and have to save up half a year to afford it on a college budget - just know to keep saving after that first purchase.",2015-08-30

I was under the impression that it could be used in dual graphics mode with my apu. I was initially disappointed because it wouldn't function in dual mode. I tried going to the newest drivers but it would still only work in single card mode. I ended up buying a more powerful card and putting this one in my closet. Just for kicks I swapped it out with my new card last week and did a video driver update and lo and behold it is now working in conjunction with my 7850. I'm pretty happy with it now as it plays my favorite game well(Skyrim) on ultra settings. The only caveat is the frame rate seems at times a bit choppy even though fraps is telling me I'm averaging mid 40's. It might be some type of stutter associated with dual mode. Other than that I'm pretty happy with it. I'm deducting one star because of the chop but for general computing and light to medium gaming the card works well. An added benefit is the fact that I used to have to turn my 7850 down to 65 watts or else it would eventually crash in games, despite the fact that I have a water cooler.

Worked fine mostly inspite of the well-known flaws of double right click issue. Main attraction for me is wireless, works with unifying stick, has some extra buttons, side tilt, and relatively small size and flatness. But the weight with 2 AA batteries remain a wrist breaker for me. So I was super excited by the new Anywhere mouse 2 with no more battery. Imagine my shock when I found out - not only you need to install a new software (Logitech &#34;Options&#34;)that doesn't do anything the existing SetPoint doesn't do, you are allowed only ONE custom profile settings.  Logitech &#34;Options&#34;, with one option. Wow, seriously. Sadistic.  I thought, this can't be true, searched the net, there's a long thread on Logitech's own forum full of angry former Anywhere mouse owners, who feel misled, cheated, at least UNDER-informed. Whether this is yet another typical Logitech sales tactic (sell you a 70% okay 30% frustration product so you will buy another one soon hoping to solve your dilemma), or idiotic oversight, it is immaterial now. I've spent $100 on yet another piece of Logitech waste-ware. I can't return it because I found out more than a week later.  If like me you are seeking a light weight small form factor mouse with at least 5 programmable buttons, horizontal tilt, AND unique profile per application, don't get this. Until Logitech fix this issue. Or check out Microsoft Comfort mouse or Razer Orochi with similar feel and usage.  (UPDATED JANUARY 2016) Less than a month after this complaint Logitech has finally updated their software Logitech Options to include Per Application Profile functionality. Their existing Logitech SetPoint continues to act stupid and conflict with Logitech Options. But for now Anywhere 2 is usable again. Unfortunate for me, I spent another $80 on a corded multi-button gaming mouse since. From 1 star I added 2 more stars.",2015-08-30

In fact I ordered it the day it was available. And I must say after receiving it, this computer has amazing specs. I hear people complaining about the textured track pad being 'annoying' but frankly if you're into gaming (I.E. THE ONLY REASON YOU'D BE PURCHASING A GAMING LAPTOP) you will love it. The textured track pad makes any kind of mouse movement feel much more responsive than on any other device I've EVER used. When it comes to gaming, for a laptop, it's hard to get much better for this price. I'm tired of people comparing gaming laptops to 2 year old custom PCs... They are completely different beasts. So be realistic and stop comparing apples to oranges. I've been able to play every game I have on ultra settings and still get over 60 fps which let's face it, is not really noticeable above that. Battery power is not an issue if you use common sense and switch performance modes away from sport to comfort or even green when you're unplugged from the wall. The included software is incredibly impressive. I mean who doesn't want to give certain apps more of a claim to bandwidth than others? In my opinion, this is an amazing rig for the money and MSI has a guaranteed repeat customer with me.",2015-08-30

It comes completely uncharged and takes up to 6 hours to be fully charged. Also, Windows 8.1 is kind of a clunky operative system and doesn't behave that good as is expected to be in a tablet/netbook pc.<br />But, here is why I give a 4 stars rating to this little device:<br />1. For the price, this device performs a very good performance,  of course I don't use it for hard work, but for casual gaming and internet surfing it is ideal. I mostly use it for reading in the Kindle app (Kindle app for Windows still has a lot or room for improvement, but it is another story) and for watching videos in YouTube.<br />2. Battery life is very long. Ok, it takes 5 hours for a full charge, but it lasts 1.5 days for me. (I always use it with the battery saver configuration which works very good for me). So I let it charging during the night and forget about this 5hours charging time thing.<br />3. It is a really usable portable device. Let's face it: I also own and Ipad, but the Ipad doesn't give me any productivity, before buying the Asus, I always preferred to use my laptop instead of a tablet, because although Windows is awful, it has the things I need. Now, I am always trying to use my Transformer instead of my laptop, because it's little form factor + productivity make me feel so comfortable.<br />4. The physical Keyboard and touch pad. I am really happy I bought a windows tablet with a physical keyboard, the experience would have been totally different without it. Typing is quicker and also the keyboard works as a nice stand for your tablet when you are watching videos. So, here is my advice for everyone buying a windows tablet: DON'T BUY WINDOWS TABLETS WITHOUT A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD, I can bet the experience would be hideous.<br />5. Another advice: DON'T BUY WINDOWS TABLETS WITH LESS THAN 2GB OF RAM. Simple, windows doesn't work well with less than 2gb.<br />Now, Why did I not give 5 stars:<br />1. Drivers issues, specially when upgrading to windows 10. Upgrading to Windows 10 was far from pleasant in this device. I had several BLUE SCREENS OF DEATH, yes and all the drama that comes with it in the middle of a Windows installation. I thought I completely ruined my tablet during the process. I have technical background so I knew how to fix it, but I wonder how a non technical user would react to this fatal errors.<br />2. I hate windows, I use it just because it is practical. But being honest it works awful and the apps available are very crappy. Facebook app is so poor, it looks just a 2010 facebook app version for ipad. Kindle:same thing, and Netflix, crashes for no reason always. Windows 10 is definitely a good improvement, but it is still klunky and awkward to use. So, another advise: DON'T BUY A WINDOWS TABLET  IF YOU WANT TO HAVE COOL APPS OR A COOL TABLET EXPERIENCE. Windows tablets are small computers, no tablets, they give a different experience to windows, and certainly make it nice to use with touch, but windows tablet are not as smooth and flawless as ipads or android tablets. Don't buy this tablet to your little kids or elders, because this is more a serious tablet, not a fun al the way easy to use tablet.",2015-08-30

I noticed that some of the apps for Android based product like this one have more features when compared to Apple products. While there are tons of apps from the Amazon store I am not able to get some of my preferred apps. These are minor issues though. I like the screen and HD quality it provides and I don't mind watching movies on the fire, this is something I don't normally do. The battery life is good and the size is perfect, not to small and not to big making it very convenient to carry around. It has easily become my favorite device.

I expected something more secure to transport a laptop component, it's not a critic, just a suggestion, maybe some bubble wrap and anti-static bag would be better.<br /><br />Finally, I had to ask a good friend of mine who made a business trip to the US to recieve the battery, cause BTExpert does not supply this product as international shipping item.
